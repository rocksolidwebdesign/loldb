|description= {{sbc|First Cast:}} Vi begins channeling, increasing the damage and range of ''Vault Breaker'' over {{fd|1.25}} seconds. Vi can still move while channeling, but she cannot attack or use her other abilities, and her movement speed is slowed by 15%.
|description2= {{sbc|Second Cast:}} Vi dashes towards the cursor's location, dealing physical damage and applying {{ai|Denting Blows|Vi}} to all enemies hit (75% damage against minions and monsters). 
<br><br>Vi stops upon colliding with an enemy champion, knocking it back.

|additional=
* Although Vi cannot use her own abilities while charging, she can still use [[summoner spells]] and [[item]] actives.
* If ''Vault Breaker'' is charged for at least 4 seconds, the channel will cancel and will go on full cooldown. Unlike similar channeled spells such as {{cai|Piercing Arrow|Varus}}, Vi is not refunded mana for cancelled attacks.
** However, if the channel of ''Vault Breaker'' is interrupted in some way (such as with hard [[crowd control]]), ''Vault Breaker'' instead goes on a short 3 second cooldown and ''does'' refund half of the mana cost to Vi.
* Non-champion enemies hit by the dash are pulled in towards Vi instead of being knocked away.
* The initial casting period of the spell counts as a slow, so any form of slow reduction (such as the Swiftness mastery) can lessen the effect of the slow.

** Unlike most forms of on-hit physical damage, ''Denting Blows''' bonus damage does not apply life steal. This is a special case, perhaps to prevent abuse or for flavor. The triggering attack will still apply life steal.
** ''Denting Blows''' bonus damage does not affect structures.
** ''Denting Blows'' will still apply if the attacks are {{ai|Riposte|Fiora|parried}} or {{ai|Aegis Protection|Pantheon|blocked}}.

* Unlike the similar ability {{cai|Silver Bolts|Vayne}}, attacking or using abilities on different targets will not remove ''Denting Blows''' stacking debuff.
* ''Denting Blows''' attack speed [[buff]] will not stack with itself with repeated applications, nor will it stack from applying it on multiple targets in quick succession.
