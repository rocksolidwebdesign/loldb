|targeting='''Moonsilver Blade''' is a passive ability with two separated effects, granting Diana a permanent passive [[attack speed]] [[buff]] and her autoattacks generate stacks on-hit. At 2 stacks, Diana gains an [[on-hit effect]] which deals damage in a [[area of effect|point blank area of effect]].

|onhiteffects=
* The triggering attack will apply other [[on-hit effects]] and can critically strike as normal.
** Critical strikes will not interact with ''Moonsilver Blade's'' damage.
** ''Moonsilver Blade'' will damage structures, but deals only 50% damage. 
** {{Pending for test}} Diana will not generate stacks or consume the empowered attack if her autoattacks are {{ai|Counter Strike|Jax|dodged}}, {{ai|Aegis Protection|Pantheon|blocked}}, {{ai|Riposte|Fiora|parried}}, or if the attack [[blind|misses]]. 
|spellshield=Will block the damage.
|additional=
* Diana's target is guaranteed to take the damage, even if they flash out of range before the attack completes (''and visually aren't within the area of effect''). 
* Unlike similar effects, such as {{ai|Double Strike|Master Yi}} and {{ai|Headshot|Caitlyn}}, there is no visible counter. However, each of the three attacks in the cycle has a distinct animation and her blade will glow when the empowered attack is ready. 
* The area of effect is centered on Diana - not her target.
