* While stated that the bonuses do not stack with themselves, that is not entirely true. When the bonus AP granted by ''Crimson Pact'' interacts with ability power modifiers, such as {{ii|Rabadon's Deathcap}} or {{mi4|Archmage}}, the bonus AP gained from those modifiers triggers more health from ''Crimson Pact''. This creates a cyclic loop. The same is also true for health modifiers, such as {{mi4|Juggernaut}} and {{ii|Spirit of the Ancient Golem}}. 
** For every 1% of a respective modifier grants an {{fd|0.035%}} bonus to the opposite statistic component.
# '''Ability Power''' Modifiers:
#* {{ii|Rabadon's Deathcap}} increases Vladimir's bonus health by {{fd|1.05%}}.
#* {{ii|Wooglet's Witchcap}} increases Vladimir's bonus health by {{fd|0.875%}}.
#* {{mi4|Archmage}} increases Vladimir's bonus health by {{ap|0.07%|0.1225%|0.175%}}.
#* {{mi4|Archmage}} & {{ii|Rabadon's Deathcap}} in combination increases Vladimir's bonus health by {{ap|1.141%|1.20925%|1.2775%}} as they stack mutiplicatively.

|{{Ability2
|targeting='''Sanguine Pool''' is a [[Area of effect|self-targeted point blank area of effect]] ability that turns Vladimir into a pool of blood for 2 seconds, making him untargetable for the duration. The damage begins immediately, so the final tick of damage occurs 0.5 seconds before he comes out of pool. The slow ends immediately once the enemy unit steps off the pool.

*''Sanguine Pool'' has no cast time. 
*''Sanguine Pool'' also scales with {{as|0.21 per ability power}} due to his passive. (which is {{as|0.0525 per ability power}} every half second.)
*While using ''Sanguine Pool'', Vladimir cannot [[autoattack]] or use his other [[Ability|abilities]]. However, he can use [[Spell|summoner spells]] and activate [[items]].
*Even though not stated in the tooltip, ''Sanguine Pool'' also gives Vladimir a {{fd|37.5}}% [[movement speed]] boost for 1 second upon activating the ability. The boost decays exponentially over that time.
**Some abilities such as {{cai|Feral Scream|Cho'Gath}} and {{cai|Petrifying Gaze|Cassiopeia}} can still affect Vladimir as he enters ''Sanguine Pool''. He will take damage and crowd control effects, but ''Sanguine Pool'' will still take effect regardless.
*Vladimir is still affected by [[damage over time]] effects (like {{si|Ignite}} and {{cai|Torment|Swain}}) that were applied before going into Sanguine Pool.
*Vladimir is untargetable by allied abilities during the duration, such as {{cai|Monsoon|Janna}} and {{cai|Aria of Perseverance|Sona}}.
**{{cai|Wish|Soraka}} will still heal him, because it will affect untargetable allies.
**Vladimir is not healed by the allied fountain while in his pool.
*When Vladimir uses ''Sanguine Pool'' he is not affected by any [[auras]], such as {{iis|Abyssal Scepter}} aura or {{ai|Tailwind|Janna}}.
*Vladimir cannot use ''Sanguine Pool'' to pass through temporary terrain created by abilities such as {{cai|Crystallize|Anivia}}, {{cai|Cataclysm|Jarvan IV}}, or {{cai|Pillar of Ice|Trundle}}.
*When in ''Sanguine Pool'', Vladimir is still stunned when passing through {{cai|Event Horizon|Veigar}}. If he does this, he will remain in his pool for its duration and remain stunned when coming out of the pool form, if the stun has not expired.

* ''Tides of Blood'' can be activated even if there are no valid targets in range. Vladimir will still gain a stack of the [[File:TidesofBlood.jpg|20px|link=]] '''Empowered''' buff.

* ''Tides of Blood'' can target and hit enemy champions that are not visible to Vladimir, including those in [[Fog of War]], in brush or in stealth.
* The '''Empowered''' buff increases the effectiveness of {{ai|Transfusion|Vladimir}},  {{ai|Sanguine Pool|Vladimir}} healing effect, allied champions' [[heal]]s, Vladimir's [[health regeneration]], [[spell vamp]], and {{si|Heal}}.

* The '''Empowered''' buff does not affect bonus [[ability power]] damage on ''Tides of Blood'' in any way.
* ''Tides of Blood'' can hit "out of range" enemies about 50 extra units away due to the in-game indicator being slightly smaller than the actual range.

|{{Ability2
|targeting=Hemoplague is a [[Area of effect|ground targeted area of effect]] ability that debuffs enemy units in the target location for 5 seconds. Debuffed units have all incoming damage amplified, and upon debuff expiration they take magic damage.
|damagetype=magic

|additional=
* Hemoplague's amplification applies to its own damage, meaning that the effective damage and scaling are {{ap|168|280|392}} {{as|(+ 78.4% AP)}}.
* Hemoplague has no cast time and affects the target area instantly. However, there is a {{fd|0.5}} second animation time that prevents Vladimir from using Transfusion and Tides of Blood. Sanguine Pool, summoner spells, and items can be used during this suppression time.
* Hemoplague will amplify almost all sources and types of damage, including damage from neutral monsters. Only [[true damage]] is exempt from amplification.
* Hemoplague's bonus and damage received stacks additively with {{ii|Deathfire Grasp}} on magic damage, resulting in 32% increased damage. Other percent damage modifiers stack multiplicately, such as Havoc.
* Casting Hemoplague on a recalling enemy will not cancel the recall, because the damage is delayed.
