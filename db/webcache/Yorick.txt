* '''Yorick''' will receive an entirely new kit. All abilities will be changed.
 
*'''Expiration Date'''	
** {{sbc|Innate:}} '''Yorick's''' magical family shovel revives one ghoul every 20 seconds. Ghouls have {{as|25% of his maximum health}} and {{as|10% of his total AD}}. '''Yorick's''' ghouls guard him by default, redirecting 10% of all damage '''Yorick''' takes to them. If '''Yorick''' commands more than 3 ghouls, they will slowly lose health over time, until only 3 ghouls remain.	
** Ghouls with the lowest health lose 10% hp per second.	
** {{ap|10|15|20%}} of all damage '''Yorick''' takes is shared or 5-10% per ghoul out.

* '''Shovel Sweep'''	
** {{sbc|Active:}} '''Yorick''' cleaves all enemies around him dealing {{ap|X|X|X|X|X}} {{as|(+ X% AD)}} physical damage. If any ghouls are alive when cast, they will also cleave in an area around them. If a champion or large jungle monster is slain within 2 seconds of being struck by this abilty, '''Yorick''' will instantly revive a ghoul.	
** When you press ''Shovel Sweep'', ghouls will "''stick''" to the units they are attacking for another 2 seconds.
 	
* '''Pestilent Ichor'''	
** {{sbc|Active:}} '''Yorick''' lobs a glob of corpse rot at a location, {{ap|X|X|X|X|X}} {{as|(+ X% AD)}} physical damage at all enemies in the explosion and slows enemies struck by 20% for 1.5 seconds. If a ghoul is in the area of effect, they will become an explosive ghoul and rush at the nearest champion, exploding upon contact and dealing {{ap|X|X|X|X|X}} {{as|(+ X% AD)}} physical damage and slowing all nearby enemies.
 
* '''Shovel 'n' Soul'''	
** {{sbc|Active:}} '''Yorick''' flings a clump of magical dirt in a line, dealing {{ap|X|X|X|X|X}} {{as|(+ X% AD)}} physical damage to the first enemy hit. '''Yorick''' can pick up the clump of dirt to restore {{ap|X|X|X|X|X}} {{as|(+ X% AD)}} health. If a ghoul is protecting '''Yorick''', he will fling it instead, causing it to pass through enemy minions. The ghouls store 50% of all damage he deals. Reactivating this ability makes the ghoul return to '''Yorick''', healing him for all of the damage stored.
 
* '''Embrace the Inevitable'''
** {{sbc|Active:}} '''Yorick''' opens a grave in the earth, instantly summoning 5 ghouls from the earth at the target loction. You can click this ability again to command the army to attack or move towards a location.	
** While "''Ghoul Army''" mode is active (''5 seconds''), the ghouls don't start losing hp.	
}}

==Map-Specific Differences==
;[[Crystal Scar]]
*{{ai|Omen of Famine|Yorick}}
**Cast range decreased to 500 from 550.
**Cooldown changed to 8 seconds from {{ap|10|9|8|7|6}} seconds.
