== Abilities ==
Shyvana's abilities have no cost related to them, and the use of her abilities is only limited by cooldowns. Instead she uses '''FURY''' as her secondary resource.

'''FURY''' is only needed as a requirement for the use of her ultimate {{ai|Dragon's Descent|Shyvana}}, which allows her to change form if she has '''100 FURY''' and remain in that state for as long as she has '''FURY'''. Shyvana won't generate '''FURY''' unless she has at least one point in {{ai|Dragon's Descent|Shyvana}}, and once she puts the first point on the skill she will gain '''100 FURY''' immediately. Any gained '''FURY''' cannot be lost except by depletion during [[File:Dragon's Descent.png|20px|link=]] '''Dragon Form'''.

** The bonus damage from ''Twin Bite'' is effective against structures.

This is a special case to prevent abuse.
* With 40% [[cooldown reduction]] and {{fd|2.5}} [[attack speed]], ''Twin Bite'' has a minimum cooldown of {{fd|1.6}} seconds.
