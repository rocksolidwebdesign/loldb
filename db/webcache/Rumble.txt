== Abilities ==
Rumble's abilities have no cost related to them, and the use of his abilities is only limited by cooldowns. Instead, he uses '''HEAT''' as his secondary resource. Rumble starts with '''0 HEAT''', and it caps at 100.

While not overheated, after 4 seconds of not using his basic abilities he will start losing '''HEAT''' at a rate of '''10 HEAT''' per second, then at a rate of '''20 HEAT''' per second {{fd|2.5}} seconds later.
