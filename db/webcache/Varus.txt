*The 40% bonus takes precedence over the 20% bonus. Any minions or monsters killed during the 6 seconds will be discarded - they do not refresh the duration nor do they create a separate buff.
*Varus' bow glows red while the minion attack speed bonus is active, and glows purple when the champion bonus is active.
