|name = Cell Division 
|icon = Cell Division.png
|description  = Each time Zac uses an ability on enemies, he sheds a chunk of himself to a nearby location. Zac can move over these chunks to reabsorb them, regaining {{as|4% of his maximum health}}. Enemies may move over these chunks to destroy them.
|description2 = Upon taking fatal damage, Zac splits into 4 [[File:Cell Division.png|20px|link=]] '''Bloblets''' that attempt to recombine. Each '''Bloblet''' has {{as|12% of Zac's maximum health}}, and 50% of his armor and magic resistance. If any of these '''Bloblets''' remain after 8 seconds, Zac will revive with 10-50% health depending on the health of the surviving chunks. <!-- PET(!?) -->

|additional =
* ''Cell Division'' has two spawn behaviors for chunks - "contestable" and "non-contestable". Non-contestable is used by default, with contestable being used if there is a ''visible'' enemy champion within 1000 units of Zac.
**{{sbc|Non-contestable:}} Chunks will fall to the ground near to Zac and can be picked up immediately.
**{{sbc|Contestable:}} Chunks will fall to the ground between Zac and the nearest enemy champion, slightly in favour of Zac. Chunks cannot be interacted with for the first 0.25 seconds, except during {{ai|Let's Bounce!|Zac}}. 
* The pick-up radius is the same for both Zac and enemy champions (50). 
* Zac's abilities cost 4% of his current health while chunks heal 4% of his maximum, a net heal of 4% of his missing health.
* Zac gets larger when his current health exceeds the base health for his level.
* {{ai|Chrono Shift|Zilean}} and {{ii|Guardian Angel}} will take precedence over ''Cell Division''.
*{{ai|Cell Division|Zac|Bloblet}}
** '''Bloblets''' are not controllable and are functionally minions.
** ''Bloblets'' can be {{si|Smite|Smited}} or {{ai|Consume|Nunu|Consumed}}.
** Allies can {{si|Teleport}} to ''Bloblets''.
** Turrets will prioritize ''Bloblets'' over other minions.
** ''Bloblets'' ignore [[Crowd_control#Types_of_Crowd_Control|knockback]] effects and take 33% reduced AoE damage.
