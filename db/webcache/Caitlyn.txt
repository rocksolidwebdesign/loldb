|name = Headshot

|description = Basic attacks generate 1 stack of ''Headshot'' (doubled when attacks from brush). Attacks against towers will not grant any stacks.
|description2 = At {{pp|3|7|6|5|1|7|13}} stacks, her next basic attack will deal bonus physical damage equal to {{as|50% of her attack damage}} (tripled against minions and monsters).

|damagetype=physical
|spelleffects=
|onhiteffects=The triggering attack will apply other [[on-hit effects]] and can critically strike as normal.
**As with most on-hit physical damage, the bonus damage from ''Headshot'' will apply [[life steal]].
**Critical Headshots will deal {{as|125% AD}}{{Times}}''critical damage'' against champions or {{as|175% AD}}{{times}}''critical damage'' against minions and monsters.
**The empowered attack will not be consumed on attacks against wards and structures.
***Attacking wards will still generate stacks towards Headshot. 
**The empowered attack will be wasted if Caitlyn's attack is {{ai|Counter Strike|Jax|dodged}}, {{ai|Aegis Protection|Pantheon|blocked}}, {{ai|Riposte|Fiora|parried}}, or if the attack [[blind|misses]].

|icon = YordleSnapTrap.jpg
|description = {{sbc|Active:}} Caitlyn sets a trap at target location that arms after a brief delay. Enemy champions who come within '''{{fd|67.5}}''' range of the trap will detonate it, becoming rooted, and taking magic damage over {{fd|1.5}} seconds. The trap also grants true sight of the target for 9 seconds.
|description2 = Caitlyn can set up to 3 traps and each lasts 4 minutes. Traps are visible to both allies and enemies. If she sets a trap when three are already placed, the oldest trap will deactivate itself.

*The knockback can be used to pass through terrain. 
*Unlike similar abilities, such as {{ai|Rocket Jump|Tristana}} and {{ai|Arcane Shift|Ezreal}}, ''90 Caliber Net'' has a short [[channel]] rather than a [[channel#Casting Times|cast time]]. This means it can be interrupted.

{{Ability info
|name = Ace in the Hole
|icon = AceintheHole.jpg
|description = {{sbc|Active:}} After a brief delay, Caitlyn locks onto a target enemy champion and channels for 1 second. While channeling, Caitlyn gains true sight of the target.
|description2 = If Caitlyn completes the channel, she will fire a '''3200'''-speed homing projectile toward the target that deals physical damage to the first enemy champion it hits. 
|leveling2 = {{lc|Physical damage}} {{ap|250|475|700}} {{as|(+ 200% bonus AD)}}
|range = {{ap|2000|2500|3000}}

|{{Ability2
|targeting='''Ace in the Hole''' is a single-target homing missile that collides with the first enemy champion in its path.
|damagetype=physical
|projectile=true
|spelleffects=single
|onhiteffects=
|spellshield=will block the ability.
|additional=
*If Caitlyn loses sight of her target before she locks on, the skill cancels. It is not put on cooldown nor will it consume any mana.
*''Ace in the Hole'' grants true sight of the target while locked on, and becoming stealthed during the channel will have no effect. The missile will follow and can still hit stealthed champions, effectively revealing their position.
*[[Pet#Clones|Clones]] will intercept the missile, as they are classified as champions for targeting purposes.
*Once Caitlyn has started channeling, she is unable to cancel the ability herself. This is unlike many other channeled abilities, such as {{ai|Nether Grasp|Malzahar}}, which can be canceled by commanding {{ci|Malzahar}} to move. 
*If the target dies or becomes untargetable during the channel, ''Ace in the Hole'' will be canceled and put on a 5 second cooldown. This will not refund the mana cost.
*If the target dies after the bullet has been fired, it will continue toward their corpse and can still be intercepted. The ability will go on full cooldown. 
*The missile will continue to follow untargetable champions, but will fizzle upon reaching them unless they become targetable before it would hit.
