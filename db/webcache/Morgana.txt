|spellshield=
|additional=
*''Black Shield'' has no cast time and does not interrupt Morgana's previous orders.
*''Black Shield'' is distinct from [[spell shield]]s and does not outright negate entire spells. If an ability applies separate [[debuff]]s for a disable and a non-disable effect, the non-disable effect will still be applied. For example, the slow from {{cai|Wall of Pain|Karthus}} will be negated, but the [[magic resistance]] reduction will not.
*''Black Shield's'' disable immunity is applied '''before''' any damage is absorbed. If a spell applies crowd control yet also has sufficient power to break the shield at the same time, the spell's effects are still negated.
*''Black Shield's'' magic damage shield will take priority over normal [[shield]]s and magic damage is always applied to it first. When used with {{iis|Hexdrinker}} [[Named item effect#Lifeline|Lifeline]], the most recent shield applied takes priority.
*''Black Shield'' does not prevent self-inflicted disables such as the silence from {{cai|Junkyard Titan|Rumble}} or the slow from {{cai|Vault Breaker|Vi}}.

|description = {{sbc|Active:}} Morgana latches chains of energy onto nearby enemy champions for 3 seconds, dealing initial magic damage to them after a brief delay of {{fd|0.5}} seconds and reducing their movement speed by 20% if the target(s) stay within 1050 range.
<br><br>If the target(s) does not break the tether after 3 seconds, they are dealt the same amount of magic damage again and they are also stunned for {{fd|1.5}} seconds.

|damagetype=magic

|onhiteffects=
|spellshield=will block the application of the tether. They will not block the stun and damage from a tether already applied.
|additional=
*If ''Soul Shackles'' only hits a single enemy, Morgana will intermediately try to chase them unless she is already moving on the opposite direction to them.
**Morgana will not automatically chase if she does not have sight of her target upon activation of the ability.
*Soul Shackles can hit nearby [[stealth]]ed champions, but does not grant sight of any sort. The visual effect of the tether will additionally not follow the target's movements as long as they remain stealthed.
*''Soul Shackles'' is not a channeled ability. As such, crowd control will not stop its effects and will persist throughout the untargetability of {{ii|Zhonya's Hourglass}}.
*''Soul Shackles''' effects will persist through pseudo-death states such as the revival of {{ii|Guardian Angel}} and {{cai|Chrono Shift|Zilean}}.
