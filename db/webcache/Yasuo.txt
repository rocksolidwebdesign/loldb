Yasuo's abilities have no cost related to them and their use is limited only by cooldowns. His secondary resource bar tracks his unique mechanic: '''[//leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Manaless#Flow Flow]'''.

Yasuo can have up to '''{{pp|18|60|65|70|75|80|90|100|110|125|140|160|185|215|250|290|340|400|470|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12|13|14|15|16|17|18}}''' Flow. Yasuo generates 1% of his maximum Flow with every 46 units he travels, requiring a total of 4600 units-traveled to obtain maximum Flow. Flow does not decay or generate idly. As Flow generation is based on distance traveled, it is also accumulated while dashing, teleporting or when displaced by crowd control effects.

|description={{sbc|Intent:}} Yasuo's critical strike chance is doubled, but the damage dealt by his critical strikes is reduced by 10% (''25% on {{ai|Steel Tempest|Yasuo}}'').

|{{Ability2
|targeting='''Way of the Wanderer''' consists of two independent passive abilities.
* '''Intent''' is a both an offensive [[buff|self-buff]] ability and a [[Critical_strike_damage#Modifying_Critical_Strike_Damage|critical damage modifier]].
* '''Resolve''' is a defensive [[buff|self-buff]] ability.

* '''Intent''':
** The damage reduction applies to the total damage dealt (''before damage mitigation''). A standard critical strike's 200% damage is reduced to 180%, and a critical strike with {{ii|Infinity Edge}} deals 225% damage instead of 250%. The reduction is '''not''' a subtraction to his [[critical strike damage]] statistic.
*** The 10% damage penalty will not affect any on-hit effect (''such as {{ii|Trinity Force}}''), with the exception of {{ii|Statikk Shiv}}.
** Critically strike with {{ai|Steel Tempest|Yasuo}} does not affect the {{ap|20|40|60|80|100}} base damage (''both for the purposes of calculating the bonus damage or being reduced by the 10% penalty''). 
* '''Resolve''':
** Any damage dealt to Yasuo when the conditions are met is instead dealt to ''Resolve's'' shield.
** Damage that is negated by the shield appears as a white indicator. For example, {{color|#FFFFFF|'''-60'''}}.

The cooldown and cast time of ''Steel Tempest'' is reduced by 1% for every 1.72% of Yasuo's bonus attack speed. <!-- I know red is the color used in Lucian's ultimate, but it looks like a dead-link on this Wiki's stylesheet.-->

* The cooldown of ''Steel Tempest'' is unaffected by cooldown reduction and is instead reduced by 1% for every {{fd|1.72%}} of his bonus attack speed. This is capped at 66% cooldown reduction with 114% bonus attack speed. At max rank, the minimum cooldown is {{fd|1.33}} seconds (''{{fd|1.4}} attack speed'').
** Yasuo's {{fd|3.2%}} attack speed per level is factored into ''Steel Tempest's'' cooldown reduction and cast time reduction. At level 18, Yasuo has a total of 54% bonus attack speed from leveling alone which reduces ''Steel Tempest's'' cooldown by 31.6% (''and he requires only 60% attack speed from items, runes and masteries to reach the cap''). ''Steel Tempest's'' cooldown is effectively reduced by {{fd|1.86%}} per level.
* {{ais|Way of the Wanderer|Yasuo}} critical strike damage penalty with ''Steel Tempest'' is 25% instead of 10%, and applies only to the AD portion of the damage. With 100% [[critical damage]] (base), the bonus damage equates to simply {{as|50% AD}} (200%{{Times}}{{fd|.75}})<!-- Tested by Emptylord. With only critical chance runes and no masteries, Steel Tempest deals 73 damage as standard (20+53) and "99!" on critical strikes. That equates to 26 bonus damage, which is ~49% of Yasuo's attack damage. Swapping out the critical strike chance runes for critical damage runes increases the damage as detailed. -->; with 150% critical damage (Base + {{ii|Infinity Edge}}), the bonus damage equates to {{as|{{fd|87.5%}} AD}} (250%{{Times}}{{fd|.75}}). <!-- Thoroughly tested. -->
* Critically striking with ''Steel Tempest'' is calculated individually for every enemy hit.
* The third cast will still knock enemies airborne when it strikes as a point-blank area of effect.
* After 333 AD, critically striking basic attacks will do more damage than critically striking Steel Tempest due to the 25% damage penalty.

* The wall grants sight over a small area.
* A '''projectile''' is any entity with a velocity that is not classified as a unit (''champions, minions, monsters, etc''). 
** Moving units are not blocked under any circumstance, including [[Dash|dash]] abilities. Champion-summoned units, such as {{cai|Command: Attack|Orianna}} and {{cai|Sapling Toss|Maokai}}, are not considered to be units until they hit the ground - and thus will interact with Wind Wall while en route.

* Yasuo can pass through terrain both before '''and after''' he's hit his target - permitting sufficient space for him to make the jump. 
* Uniquely, all forms of movement-inhibiting crowd control (''airborne, snares, stuns, suppression, etc.'') will interrupt ''Sweeping Blade'' when they hit him - rather than waiting for him to complete the dash. This is contrary to all other dashes, which are only interrupted by airborne-type crowd control effects.
* The cooldown of ''Sweeping Blade'' is unaffected by cooldown reduction.

{{Ability info
|name=Last Breath
|icon=Last Breath.png
|description={{sbc|Active:}} Yasuo blinks to the nearest visible '''Airborne''' enemy champion to the cursor, instantly generating maximum '''Flow'''. Upon arriving, he suspends all airborne units within a '''400'''-radius of his target in the air for 1 second.
|description2=Once he lands, Yasuo deals physical damage to all nearby units and gains 50% penetration to ''bonus'' armor for 15 seconds (''this affects armor from items, buffs, runes and masteries''). Casting ''Last Breath'' will reset the chain on {{ai|Steel Tempest|Yasuo}}.

|cooldown={{ap|80|55|30}}
|range=1200
}}
|{{Ability2
|targeting='''Last Breath''' is an [[auto-targeted]] ability that can only be activated if there is an airborne enemy champion nearby. The cursor's current position will influence the ability's auto-targeting, although it is not technically using [[quick cast]] and having your cursor near a valid target is not required to activate the ability. 
|damagetype=physical

|video=Yasuo RVideo.ogv
|additional=
* ''Last Breath'' will attempt to position Yasuo outside the range of a nearby enemy turret if he initiates the ability on an enemy standing close to one. This does not, however, apply to the [[Nexus Obelisk]].
* ''Last Breath's'' damage will benefit from its own bonus penetration.
* '''Bonus armor''' refers to all sources of armor beyond the target's base armor and armor per level. '''Bonus armor''' refers specifically to armor granted through: runes, masteries, items, auras/buffs and champion abilities.
* The bonus armor penetration applies '''before''' percentage armor penetration. 
** Using {{ii|Last Whisper}} as an example: "Subtract half the enemy's bonus armor, then subtract 35% of the total remaining armor" <ref>[http://community.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/c/gameplay/WkrQsd6z-how-does-yasuos-ult-penetration-work?comment=0002 CertainlyT gives the formula for Last Breath's armor penetration]</ref>.
* When ''Last Breath'' is used, the duration of the target being airborne becomes 1 second, regardless of the existing airborne duration caused by a prior displacement ability, as well as any additional airborne duration created by a displacement ability during ''Last Breath's'' animation.
** For example, if Yasuo uses ''Last Breath'' on targets knocked up by {{cai|Unstoppable Force|Malphite}} instantly the moment they were knocked up, then those targets' duration of being airborne becomes 1 second, not 1.5 seconds as a result of {{cai|Unstoppable Force|Malphite}}. If Yasuo uses ''Last Breath'' on targets knocked up by {{cai|Unstoppable Force|Malphite}} the moment they are about to land, then the duration of the targets being airborne totals to 2.5 seconds.
*** Therefore, to maximize the duration of a target being airborne, ''Last Breath'' is best used right when the target is about to land from a prior displacement ability.
* Targets suspended by ''Last Breath'' cannot be displaced any further until the ability is completed.
* Note that "Airborne" is a classification of enemy-enforced crowd control and not a visual description. Only airborne-type crowd control sourced from an '''enemy''' champion will count for the purposes of ''Last Breath''.
** [[Dash|Jumps]], including abilities recognized as {{texttip|self-CC|Zigg's self-knockback with Satchel Charge}}, do not classify the unit as being Airborne.
** Bouncing animations, such as {{ci|Zac}} during {{ai|Let's Bounce!|Zac}}, do not classify the unit as being Airborne (''though the enemy targets he hits with it are knocked Airborne and will function with Last Breath'').
