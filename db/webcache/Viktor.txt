|description  = Viktor starts each game with an exclusive {{ii|Prototype Hex Core}}, which permanently occupies one of his item slots. For [[Gold|<font style="color:gold;">1000 gold</font>]], Viktor can upgrade his ''Hex Core'' to increase its stats and grant him one ''Evolution'' point, which he can use to augment one of his basic abilities. Once he augments all of his basic abilities, Viktor will automatically augment his ultimate ability, {{ai|Chaos Storm|Viktor}}.
* {{ii|Prototype Hex Core}}: Grants Viktor +3 ability power per level.
* {{ii|The Hex Core mk-1|The Hex Core MK-1}}: Grants +4 ability power per level, +20 ability power, 150 mana and 1 Evolution Point. 
* {{ii|The Hex Core mk-2|The Hex Core MK-2}}: Grants +5 ability power per level, +40 ability power, 300 mana and 1 Evolution Point. 
* {{ii|Perfect Hex Core}}: Grants Viktor +6 ability power per level, +60 ability power, 500 mana and 1 Evolution Point.

* The calculated value of 20 ability power and 150 mana, compared to other items, is 837 gold. Given that 1 ability power has a value of {{fd|21.75}}g, each of Viktor's upgrades will be at least 100% gold efficient at level 8. Factoring the 3 ability power per level that he gains for free, the item is gold efficient at level 2. 
* At level 18, The Perfect Hex Core grants a total of 168 ability power. Including the 500 mana, the item is worth 4654 gold (not including any passives).

* There is a known graphical bug in which the beam visual-effect is stuck on the place in which it was originally cast, but the damaging part of the ability performs normally, damaging units in the intended location.
* If Viktor dies while he is firing the beam it will become interrupted and deal damage up to the location where it was in the moment Viktor died.

* ''Chaos Storm'' can be controlled by Alt + Right-Click or by pressing the R button (''default hotkeys''). It can be commanded to move toward locations or enemy champions (''it will continue to follow the chosen enemy champion unless commanded otherwise'').
* If Viktor is affected by hard-CC he cannot issue new commands to the singularity.
* If the champion the storm is currently following enters [[stealth]], the singularity will continue to follow them, effectively giving away their position. 
* The singularity grants sight around its position for the full duration.
* ''Chaos Storm'' remains active and continues to deal damage if Viktor dies. 
** When Viktor dies, the singularity immediately stops moving and cannot be subsequently redirected. 
* '''Probable Bug:''' If ''Chaos Storm'' is summoned in a brush where the enemy has no vision, it will remain invisible to the enemy team for its duration even if it is redirected out of the bush. This may be a bug.
** Aside from when the bug occurs, the ''Chaos Storm'' will be visible to enemies for its duration even if it enters a brush or the fog of war.
