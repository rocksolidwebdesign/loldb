* Azir must rank his {{ai|Arise!|Azir}} ability first. In [[Dominion]] and [[ARAM]], Azir will start the game with one point already in {{ai|Arise!|Azir}} with only two points to allocate to other abilities.
* Azir cannot cast his {{ai|Conquering Sands|Azir}} or {{ai|Shifting Sands|Azir}} without a [[#Sand Soldier|Sand Soldier]] active on the field.
* Azir's basic attacks do not utilize a projectile, and will bypass {{ai|Wind Wall|Yasuo}} and {{ai|Unbreakable|Braum}}.

* The soldiers will stop when encountering {{ai|Wind Wall|Yasuo}} and {{ai|Unbreakable|Braum}} during their charge. 
* The charge begins slightly behind {{ci|Azir}}, making the E+R combo easier to perform.
* Mechanically, the wall is made up of a number of units that [[knockback]] enemies who try to pass over them. 
**The wall is bidirectional and will prevent enemies from passing over the wall in either direction.
**The wall will intercept enemies who attempt to pass over the wall regardless of whether the mobility was voluntary (i.e. dashes) or otherwise (e.g. {{ai|Headbutt|Alistar}} and {{ai|Rocket Grab|Blitzcrank}}).
** Enemies with crowd control immunity will be able to [[dash]] over the wall. This includes all dashes that are classified as "unstoppable" (e.g. {{ai|Unstoppable Force|Malphite}} and {{ai|Paranoia|Nocturne}}), but also any enemy protected by {{ai|Black Shield|Morgana}}, and {{ci|Olaf}} during {{ai|Ragnarok|Olaf}} (via {{ai|Dark Passage|Thresh}}).
* Dashes or mobility that occurs while untargetable, such as {{ai|Twisted Advance|Maokai}} and {{ai|Playful|Fizz}}, can bypass the wall.
** Despite Riot explicitly stating that {{ai|Sanguine Pool|Vladimir}} will bypass the wall, it does not. This could be a bug. 
* [[Blink|Blinks]] are distinct from dashes and can bypass the wall (e.g. {{si|Flash}}, {{ai|Arcane Shift|Ezreal}} and {{ai|Crowstorm|Fiddlesticks}}).
* The wall of soldiers '''will''' count as terrain for the purposes of "into terrain" effects (such as {{ai|Condemn|Vayne}} and {{ai|Dredge Line|Nautilus}}). This will only affect enemies - allies will pass through the wall in all circumstances, even if knocked into it by an enemy (ally Nautilus using his Q on the wall??).
* Common misconceptions:
** {{ai|Dark Passage|Thresh}} is considered to be a dash and will be blocked.
** {{ai|Last Breath|Yasuo}} is considered a blink and will not be blocked.
