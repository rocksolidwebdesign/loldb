* The movement speed buff refreshes each time Fiora autoattacks within the first 3 seconds. This allows the movement speed buff to last up to a maximum of 6 seconds total if she performs an attack at the very beginning of the attack speed buff, and an attack at the very last moment of the attack speed buff.

* [[On-hit effects]] damage are not reduced by ''Blade Waltz'' damage reduction on the same target.
* Fiora will reappear next to the last enemy champion she attacks. Fiora will appear at her initial target unless they die or if she loses sight of them.
* ''Blade Waltz'' will prioritize blinking to new targets if within range of addition enemy champions before blinking back to an already struck target(s).
* When blinking next to an enemy champion, there is a small period of time of when she is targetable. She can take damage from area of effect abilities during this time and a turret's aggro will keep on re-locking to her if within range.
