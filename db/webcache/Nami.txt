|additional=
* ''Aqua Prison'' acts as a knockup for the purpose of {{cai|Last Breath|Yasuo}}.
* It seems to take {{fd|~0.875}} seconds from cast to land (there's wind-up before the bubble is launched) regardless of distance. The AoE has a radius of ~162, making it impossible to escape only if an enemy is at 185 movement speed or less (325 movement speed slowed by 43% would put an enemy within this). This means that CC may be necessary to ensure that this CC lands. Rank 5 {{ai|Tidecaller's Blessing|Nami}} with 160 AP could reach this slow value (though few enemies would likely have 325 movement speed by that time).
