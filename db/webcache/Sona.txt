The effect does not change if abilities are used while the projectile is in motion.
** If ''Power Chord'' reaches its third charge using {{ai|Crescendo|Sona}}, its effect will be that of the active aura at that time, or that of whichever ability Sona uses thereafter.
** If no song is playing when ''Power Chord'' is ready, it will have no effect and the buff is consumed after the next autoattack. 
* Sona's auras will only affect allied champions, not [[minion]]s or [[pets]].
* ''Power Chord'' affects [[turret]]s, [[inhibitor]]s, and the [[nexus]], but {{ai|Aria of Perseverance|Sona|Diminuendo's}} damage debuff does not.
* ''Power Chord'' resets Sona's attack timer when it is ready.
