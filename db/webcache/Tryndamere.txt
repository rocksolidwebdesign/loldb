== Abilities ==
Tryndamere's abilities have no cost related to them, and the use of his abilities is only limited by cooldowns. Instead he uses '''FURY''' as his secondary resource. Tryndamere starts with '''0 FURY''', and has a cap of '''100 FURY'''. He gains 5 '''FURY''' per autoattack, plus 5 extra '''FURY''' per critical strike and 10 extra '''FURY''' per any unit he kills. <!-- Using Spinning Slash on enemies also grants Fury. !!! Need checking! --> When out of combat for 8 seconds, Tryndamere loses '''5 FURY''' every second.
