|name=Rebirth
|icon=Rebirth.png
|description=Upon taking lethal damage, Anivia will transform into an egg with 100% health. While in egg form, Anivia is unable to make any actions and her armor and magic resistance are modified by {{pp|5|&minus;40|&minus;25|&minus;10|+5|+20|1|5|8|12|15}}. If her egg survives for 6 seconds, Anivia is revived with the same percentage health that her egg had.

* Triggering ''Rebirth'' will remove all debuffs from Anivia, including {{ai|Children of the Grave|Mordekaiser}}.
* Triggering ''Rebirth'' while affected by a channelled ability like {{ai|Drain|Fiddlesticks}} or {{ai|Nether Grasp|Malzahar}} will not end the channel early and the egg will still take damage.
*Triggering ''Rebirth'' while supressed by {{ai|Hyper-Kinetic Position Reverser|Urgot}} will remove the cc and the swap will not happen (unlike with other forms of CC removal).
*Triggering ''Rebirth'' while leashed by an ability like {{ai|Ethereal Chains|LeBlanc}} will make the secondary effect trigger at the moment of Anivia's "death" and the egg will not take the damage.
* {{ii|Guardian Angel}} and {{ai|Chrono Shift|Zilean}} will take precedence over ''Rebirth''. {{ai|Omen of Death|Yorick}} will trigger after ''Rebirth'', if its duration persists. 
* Anivia can be moved by [[crowd control|knock-abouts]], but is unaffected by other forms of crowd control. 
* While in egg form, Anivia is still classified as a champion (''unlike {{cai|Cell Division|Zac}}'').
