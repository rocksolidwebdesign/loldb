== Abilities ==
{{ci|Udyr}} uses the [[stance]] mechanic. His abilities all have a persistent effect which remain until he activates another ability. Each ability also has a temporary activation effect that occurs upon being cast; the temporary effect of each stance persists for its full duration even if '''Udyr''' changes stance again. Switching stances sets off a 2 second static global cooldown.

All of {{cis|Udyr}} abilities have 5 ranks, but as '''Udyr''' can only gain a maximum of 18 skill points at level 18, he cannot ever max out all of his abilities. He may max three abilities (with the fourth only reaching its 3rd rank) or he may max two abilities (with the other two reaching their 4th rank).

**Unlike most on-hit physical damage, the bonus damage from ''Tiger Stance'' will not apply [[life steal]].
**Critical strikes do not interact with the bonus damage from ''Tiger Stance''.
**The persistent onhit physical damage can successfully be {{ai|Counter Strike|Jax|dodged}}, {{ai|Riposte|Fiora|parried}} and {{ai|Aegis Protection|Pantheon|blocked}}.
***However, they do not prevent application of the active DoT.
**If Udyr is [[blind]]ed, neither the persistent damage nor the active damage will be applied, and it will consume the empowered attack of the active.
|spellshield=will not block the enhanced autoattack.

*Despite being an on-hit effect, ''Tiger Stance's'' active DoT will trigger spell effects as a damage-over-time spell, such as [[spell vamp]] and the reduced version of {{ii|Rylai's Crystal Scepter|Rylai's}} slow.
*''Tiger Stance's'' DoT does not stack; applying it again only refreshes the duration.
*''Tiger Stance's'' primed DoT does not persist through stance changes.
