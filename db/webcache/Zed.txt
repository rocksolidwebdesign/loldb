{{Ability info
|name = Death Mark
|icon = Death Mark.jpg
|description = {{sbc|Active:}} Zed becomes untargetable for {{fd|0.75}} seconds and dashes behind the target enemy champion. Upon arrival, he marks the target for death, ignores unit collision, and spawns a shadow that lasts for 6 seconds at the cast location. Reactivating ''Death Mark'' will cause Zed to swap places with this shadow.
|description2 = After 3 seconds, ''Death Mark'' will trigger, dealing flat physical damage plus a percentage of all physical and magic damage dealt to the marked champion while it was active.

|{{Ability2
|targeting='''Death Mark''' is a single-targeted dash ability.
|damagetype=physical
|spelleffects=single target
|onhiteffects=
|spellshield=Will block the entire application of the mark, '''including''' Zed's untargetability and dash, but it will not block the detonation of a mark already applied.
|additional=
* After using ''Death Mark'', Zed can blink back to his shadow from any range.
* If the target dies before Zed reachs the target (in 0.75 seconds dash time), Zed will appear at the original place and  ''Death Mark'' will be canceled and put on a 5 second cooldown
** If this happens, Zed will leave a glitched out shadow from where his shadow was supposed to be in the first place. This shadow will remain indefinitely and will in fact mimic all of Zed's abilities (so he can have up to four shurikens at once). He cannot switch to this shadow, however. 
* Death Mark can be removed with [[Quicksilver]]. Death Mark can also be prevented by becoming untargetable before Zed strikes you.
* The shadow is functionally the same as {{ai|Living Shadow|Zed}} for ability casts.
** A third shuriken hitting the same target deals 50% damage, not 25%.
** A third slash hitting the same target applies the same slow as two.
* Magic and physical damage is calculated from all abilities, items and buffs.
** Damage is calculated with pre-mitigation values <ref>[http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=31026026#31026026 CertainlyT explains the mark's damage calculation]</ref>.
** [[True damage]], such as from {{si|Ignite}}, is not counted.
* If ''Death Mark's'' damage is sufficient to kill an enemy, a shuriken appears above the marked champion's head along with a cloud of smoke surrounding them. If the target's health is replenished in any way that will let the target survive, the swirling shuriken mark will disappear. The red mark inside the target that denotes the mark's existence will remain for the full three seconds, however (unless removed by means of {{si|Quicksilver Sash}} or {{si|Mercurial Scimitar}}).
