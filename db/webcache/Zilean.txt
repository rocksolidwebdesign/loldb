{{Ability info
|name = Time Bomb
|icon = TimeBomb.jpg
|description = {{sbc|Active:}} Zilean places a ticking time bomb on any unit, allied or enemy, which detonates after 4 seconds, dealing magic damage in a '''330'''-unit area. 
|description2 = Bombs will detonate immediately if the holder dies or if another bomb is placed on them.

|targeting='''Time Bomb''' can target a single unit, either ally or enemy.
An exploding bomb is an [[area of effect]] at its last location.
|damagetype=magic
|spelleffects=area of effect
|spellshield=Will only block the placement of a bomb. Spell shields will not block the detonation nor the damage in any circumstance.
|additional=
* Time Bomb will cancel an enemy champions recall.
* If a bomb is placed on a stealthed ally, it will not be visible to the enemy team.
* A ticking bomb will draw turret aggro.
* A ticking bomb does not grant an assist if the target dies before it explodes.
* A bomb will detonate an enemy Zilean's bomb when placed on the same unit. This does not prevent the enemy's damage.
* If a bomb carrier takes lethal damage and triggers a revive effect, such as {{ai|Chrono Shift|Zilean}} or {{ii|Guardian Angel}}, the bomb is removed like all other debuffs.
* A ticking bomb will still detonate even if the carrier becomes untargetable. The carrier will still take damage unless they are also invulnerable, through effects such as {{ai|Frozen Tomb|Lissandra}} or {{ii|Zhonya's Hourglass}}. 
* Various champions that have abilities that make them untargetable can prevent the damage from ''Time Bomb'', such as Vladimir,  Elise,  Fizz,  Lissandra, Shaco, Fiora, Zed, Master Yi, or  Maokai.
