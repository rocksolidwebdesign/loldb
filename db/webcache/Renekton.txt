== Abilities ==
Renekton's abilities have no cost related to them and their use is limited only by cooldowns. Instead, he uses '''FURY''' as his secondary resource. Renekton starts with '''0 FURY''' and it is capped at 100. Renekton gains 5 Fury with each auto-attack, and with the use of some of his abilities. When Renekton has 50 or more '''FURY''', his next ability will consume '''50 FURY''' for an enhanced effect. '''FURY''' will decay at a rate of 5 per 2 seconds if Renekton has not dealt or received damage in the last 12 seconds. <!-- We need a redesign! -->
