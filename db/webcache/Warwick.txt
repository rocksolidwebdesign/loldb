*The healing portion is independent from the damage portion of the ability, meaning the heal is always the same regardless of the damage dealt to the target.
<!-- * Because it is an [[on-hit effect]], {{ai|Eternal Thirst|Warwick}} can be blocked by {{ai|Aegis Protection|Pantheon}} , {{ai|Counter Strike|Jax}} or {{ai|Riposte|Fiora}} and Warwick will not be healed. -->
* Disregarding bonus Attack Damage, ''Eternal Thirst'' is an equivalent of ~ 5% / 10% / 15% Lifesteal at level 1 to ~ 14% / 27% / 41% Lifesteal at level 18.
