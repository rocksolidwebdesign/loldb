* ''Mana Barrier's'' cooldown starts as soon as it activates, not when it ends.
* Any damage that puts Blitzcrank below 20% of his max. health is instead dealt to ''Mana Barrier''.
* If Blitzcrank is killed from anywhere higher than 20% of his max. health (''e.g. from massive burst damage''), ''Mana Barrier'' will not activate and it will not go on cooldown.
* If Blitzcrank is already below 20% of his max. health when ''Mana Barrier's'' cooldown ends, it will not activate until he takes damage again.

* ''Rocket Grab'' has a {{fd|0.25}} second casting time <ref>[http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=41352754#41352754 CertainlyT on hook abilities]</ref>.
* ''Rocket Grab's'' damage is dealt on impact, not after the target is pulled. 
* ''Rocket Grab'' can hit and pull [[stealth]]ed units. This will not explicitly reveal the stealthed enemy, but can/will reveal {{ci|Akali}}, {{ci|Evelynn}} and {{ci|Teemo}} due to the conditions of their stealth. 
* ''Rocket Grab'' can be used to pull enemies through terrain.
* ''Rocket Grab'' will not pull {{ci|Baron Nashor}}, {{ci|Dragon}} or {{ci|Vilemaw}}, although it will still damage them.
* ''Rocket Grab'' will damage {{ai|H-28G Evolution Turret|Heimerdinger}} and visible {{ai|Jack In The Box|Shaco}}, but will not pull these traps towards Blitzcrank. Invisible boxes will neither take damage or be pulled. 
* Blitzcrank will attempt to attack enemy champions that are successfully pulled towards him.
* {{si|Cleanse}}, {{ai|Remove Scurvy|Gangplank}} or {{ii|Quicksilver Sash}} used by enemy champions while being pulled will not interrupt ''Rocket Grab'' and the champion will reach Blitzcrank.
* Blitzcrank cannot use {{si|Flash}} if hits a pullable target until his target reaches him.
* Forced action and airborne [[crowd control]] effects that affect the target during the grab will stop the grab <ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&feature=endscreen&v=PTezJPONkZM Fearing a grabbed target]</ref>.
* Abilities with casting times are not interrupted by ''Rocket Grab'' (''or any crowd control'') and will go off as if Blitzcrank hadn't grabbed them. 
** For skill shots, such as {{ai|Final Spark|Lux}}, they will fire from the point of cast regardless of the caster's position when the casting time ends. 
** For dashes and blinks, such as {{ai|Arcane Shift|Ezreal}}, the caster will blink to the target location after the casting time regardless of crowd control effects. Blitzcrank's arm will visibly stretch and then fizzle. 
* Contrary to popular belief, you cannot cast {{cai|Arcane Shift|Ezreal}} ''during Rocket Grab''. However, as of [[V1.0.0.140]], spells cast while disabled will immediately be cast after the effect ends.
* If Blitzcrank is moved after ''Rocket Grab'' hits a target, the target will be pulled to Blitzcrank's starting location.
