*''To the Skies!'' does not follow the target's movements; if the target uses a movement ability or {{si|Flash}}, Jayce will still land at the target's original position.
**''To the Skies!'' will bring Jayce to a location linearly in front of his target.
* ''Shock Blast'' briefly reveals [[Fog of War]] in the area where it explodes.
** ''Shock Blast's'' range increase when used with {{ai|Acceleration Gate|Jayce}} is not affected by when the projectile actually passes through the gate; the boost simply re-targets ''Shock Blast'' to reach a location further along the same path of travel, but further away from Jayce's original position.
