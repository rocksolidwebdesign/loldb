|cleansing=[[Stun]] is a form of crowd control that prevents the target from moving, declaring attacks or casting abilities. However, they may still cast summoner spells (excluding {{si|Flash}} and {{si|Teleport}}). [[Slow]] is a form of crowd control that reduces the target's movement speed. 
*Slows stack with diminishing returns. Slows that would reduced below 220 movement speed are further modified, and the target's movement speed cannot be reduced below 110. 
*The stun will interrupt [[channel]]ed and [[channel|charged]] abilities.
*The duration of both is reduced by [[tenacity]], although the slow is refreshed so long as you remain in the field. 
*The slow's strength is reduced by [[slow resist]]. 
*Both can be removed with [[Quicksilver]], {{ii|Mikael's Crucible}}, {{si|Cleanse}} and [[Crowd control#Champion abilities|certain champion abilities]].
*Both will be ignored by targets with [[Crowd control#Preventing|crowd control immunity]], such as {{ai|Black Shield|Morgana}}.
*{{ii|Liandry's Torment}} will deal double damage against stunned and slowed enemies.
