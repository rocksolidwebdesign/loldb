* ''Backstab's'' bonus damage applies to Shaco's autoattacks and abilities, except for {{ai|Jack In The Box|Shaco}}.
** ''Backstab'' does not increase the damage from [[summoner spell]]s or items.
* ''Backstab'' also applies after a critical strike is achieved. If you were to critically strike for 500 damage, the same critical strike would do 600 damage from behind (500 + 120% = 600 damage).

{{Ability info
|name = Deceive
|icon = Deceive.jpg
|description = {{sbc|Active:}} Shaco instantly blinks to a target nearby location and enters stealth for up to {{fd|3.5}} seconds. Dealing damage will break stealth early. His next basic attack within 6 seconds is guaranteed to critically strike for modified base critical damage. 
|description2 = Bonus critical damage from items, runes and mastery is applied for the full amount.

* ''Deceive's'' damage bonus replaces the normal critical strike modifier, causing it to actually do less than a normal critical until the skill is at least at rank 4. It is affected by critical damage bonuses like {{ii|Infinity Edge}}.
** ''Deceive'' will apply bonus critical damage on top of its modifier. For instance, with {{ii|Infinity Edge}} (+50%) and Rank 5 ''Deceive'', Shaco will deal bonus damage equal to 170% of his attack damage (crit=100% + 50% bonus from IE +20% bonus from Rank 5 ''Deceive'') . This is before any other bonuses or mitigation are applied. Note that if Shaco were to attack the target from behind it would deal 20% additional damage on top of the critical strike itself making the total damage of the attack equal to 324% of Shaco's total attack damage.
* i.e. Shaco has 150 attack damage:
** Rank 5 ''Deceive'' crit from behind with Infinity Edge = [150 + ([1.20 + .50]*150)]*1.20 = 486 total damage.
*''Deceive's'' casting animation (an orange puff of smoke) can be seen by both teams through the [[Fog of War]].

{{Ability info
|name = Jack In The Box
|icon = JackInTheBox.jpg
|description = {{sbc|Active:}} Shaco summons a [[#Pets|box]] at the target location that stealths after a 2 second delay and lasts for up to 60 seconds. When an enemy comes within '''300''' units, the box springs open: causing surrounding enemies to turn and flee while it attacks nearby enemies for up to 5 seconds.

|additional=
*Casting ''Jack In The Box'' creates a puff of smoke that is visible even through brush and the fog of war, and makes a distinctive sound that can be heard by enemies.
*''Boxes'' are immune to ability damage and displacement effects while in stealth. As such, they can be used to block skill shots. 
*''Boxes'' will not be triggered by enemies that Shaco does not have sight of. As boxes grant sight, this is only true against stealthed enemies, or while Shaco is affected by {{ai|Paranoia|Nocturne}} and {{ai|Smokescreen|Graves}}).
*Stealthed boxes will be revealed and disabled by {{ii|Sweeping Lens}}. 
*The fear can affect [[stealth]]ed enemy champions, but it will not reveal them unless the target's stealth state depends on their location or movement (e.g. {{cai|Camouflage|Teemo}} or {{cai|Twilight Shroud|Akali}}).

|description2= The clone deals 75% of Shaco's damage and receives 50% extra damage. This clone deals 50% damage to towers and inhibitors. At the end of its duration or when dying the clone will explode, dealing magic damage to enemies within '''250'''-range.

|onhiteffects=The clone will apply on hit-effects just a Shaco would.
|spellshield=Will block the clone's explosion.
|additional=
*The clone will not apply spell effects with its attacks, just its explosion.
* While the clone is active, you can use the spell again in order to issue commands, similarly with Alt-Right Clicking. Each "activation" of the spell will cause the clone to move towards the cursor location or to attack whichever enemy unit the cursor is hovering over. 
*Shaco briefly becomes untargetable when casting ''Hallucinate''.
**With proper timing, Hallucinate can be used to avoid projectiles before they hit him (e.g. {{cai|Ace in the Hole|Caitlyn}} or {{cai|Requiem|Karthus}}). However, it cannot be used to avoid ticks of {{si|Ignite}} or {{cai|Time Bomb| Zilean}}. The duration timer will pause and continue once Shaco is targetable again.
*The clone will receive its own [[Banshee's Veil]], [[Guardian Angel]] or other item buffs.
*The clone cannot be the source of [[aura]] buffs, but it can still be affected by nearby auras.
*''Hallucinate'' spawns Shaco and his clone with consistent orientations. Shaco faces the same direction as he did when the ability was cast. The clone faces towards the top of the screen.
*Shaco's clone will benefit from certain stats gained from items from attack speed and crit chance.
*Shaco's Clone will not benefit from certain item effects such as:
**[[Spellblade]] and [[Youmuu's Ghostblade]]'s active
*Runes and Masteries do not increase the clones stats.
**The clone displays its real stats, which makes it fairly easy to find the real Shaco.
*Shaco's Clone is also capable of picking up [[Health Relic]]s on [[Dominion]] and [[Howling Abyss]].
*Shaco's Clone cannot lifesteal.
