* The pillar grants sight within {{tt|600|Estimated}}-range.
* The pillar cannot be placed inside impassable terrain. Attempting to do so will cause the pillar to spawn in the nearest available spot of accessible terrain, similar to {{ii|Sight Ward|wards}} and pets such as {{cai|Yordle Snap Trap|Caitlyn}}.
* Pillar Of Ice deals 1 damage for it to trigger in-combat effects such as drawing [[tower]] aggro and cancelling the effects of out-of-combat abilities such as {{ai|Strut|Miss Fortune}} and {{ai|Perseverance|Garen}}.

|name = Subjugate
|icon = Subjugate.jpg
|description  = {{sbc|Active:}} Trundle drains the life force out of an enemy champion, dealing magic damage equal to a percentage of his target's maximum health and [[heal]]ing himself for the same amount, as well as stealing 40% of the target's armor and magic resist. 
<br/><br/> Half of the stats are drained immediately and the other half over the next 4 seconds. The armor and magic resist modifier slowly decays for both Trundle at his target over 4 seconds after the drain completes.

|targeting='''Subjugate''' is a [[unit-targeted]] ability.

|onhiteffects=
|spellshield=will block the ability.
|additional=
* The total value of armor and magic resistance drained is determined ''at the point of cast'' and does not adjust if the target's armor or magic resistance subsequently changes. This means that ''Subjugate'' cast on a target possessing a temporary defensive [[buff]] will in actuality steal significantly more than 40% of the target's armor and magic resistance if it wears off mid-drain, or vice versa if it is applied mid-drain.
** Contrary to what happens with armor and magic resistance, temporary changes to maximum health such as {{ai|Wild Growth|Lulu}} will not cause ''Subjugate'' to deal more or less damage than intended.
* If Trundle or his target is killed mid-drain, the drain is regarded as complete and will begin to to return the gained / lost stats immediately.
