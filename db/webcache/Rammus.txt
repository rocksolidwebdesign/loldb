*Due to his base armor and armor increase per level, Rammus effectively receives a bonus to his base attack damage (~5) and additional attack damage per level (~1) up to ~21 bonus attack damage at level 18.
* Any buff or debuff that affects Rammus' armor will increase or reduce the bonus damage respectively as well. (e.g. {{ai|Bulwark|Galio}} or {{ai|Spirit Fire|Nasus}})
** Similarly to {{cai|Runic Skin|Galio}}, ''Spiked Shell'' will cause a decrease in attack damage if Rammus' armor is reduced below 0.
