* An enemy cannot be hit by multiple bolts. If blocked by a spell shield, you still count as having been hit and cannot be hit again.
* There is a short delay before the ability can be reactivated. While primarily to prevent accidental detonations, it adds a minimum distance travelled of approximately 500 units.
* 1050 is the maximum distance that each bolt can travel. Factoring in the split, ''Plasma Fission'' can hit targets up to 1485 units away.
