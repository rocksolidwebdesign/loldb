**[[File:WukongSquare.png|20px|link=Wukong#Decoy]] [[Wukong#Decoy|Champion clones]]
*Any enemy {{si|Teleport|Teleports}} on a grabbed target will be cancelled when the unit goes into stasis, going on full cooldown.
**Casting {{si|Teleport}} on Syndra herself will cause her to cancel ''Force of Will'' and drop anything she is holding.
*Enemy [[pet]]s that passively have an effect on their surroundings will continue to affect the area around them while they are being held. For example, {{cai|Summon Tibbers|Annie|Tibbers}} will continue to inflict burn damage on surrounding units while in stasis.
*Grabbing a {{ai|Dark Sphere|Syndra}} will cause the duration on it to refresh, but only on the first cast, not when it is thrown.
*''Force of Will'' has additional effects when targeting the {{ci|Ancient Golem}} and {{ci|Lizard Elder}}. Throwing the former will refund 10 [[mana]] to Syndra upon cast and will reduce the cooldown of ''Force of Will'' by 1 second, while throwing the latter will apply the {{bi|Blessing of the Lizard Elder}} burn to any affected units in the area of effect.

*Casting ''Unleashed Power'' on a target that becomes [[untargetable]] while the spheres are in flight will cause all spheres to be deal no damage and be destroyed.
