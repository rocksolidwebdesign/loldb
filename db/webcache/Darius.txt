* ''Noxian Guillotine'' does not go on cooldown or consume mana until the ability strikes the target (including if it is blocked by a spell shield or is invulnerable). If the target is killed before the blow hits, it will not go on cooldown.
* The cooldown of ''Noxian Guillotine'' will begin to tick down after the ability's first cast and ''not'' when the buff expires. Five consecutive executions with maximum delay between casts will remove 100 seconds of downtime from ''Noxian Guillotine'', which leaves only 20 seconds of downtime at rank 1 and no downtime at ranks 2 and 3.
* During the leap, Darius is considered to be channeling and can be interrupted by hard [[crowd control]].
