|description = Whenever Lulu or the allied target of {{ai|Help, Pix!|Lulu}} attacks an enemy (excluding structures and wards), ''Pix'' fires a barrage of 3 homing bolts toward the same target that deal {{pp|9|3|7|11|15|19|23|27|31|35|1|3|5|7|9|11|13|15|17}} {{as|(+ 5% AP)}} magic damage each to the first enemy they each hit, for a maximum possible {{pp|9|9|21|33|45|57|69|81|93|105|1|3|5|7|9|11|13|15|17}} {{as|(+ 15% AP)}} magic damage.

|targeting='''Pix, Faerie Companion''' is a passive ability that fires three projectiles towards Lulu's target whenever she makes a basic attack. These are targeted but can be blocked by enemies in the way.

|damagetype=magic
|projectile=true
|onhiteffects=Does not apply [[on-hit effect]]s.
|spellshield=Will not block the damage.

* ''Pix, Faerie Companion'' will only fire with basic attacks and will not fire with abilities that proc [[on-hit]] effects like {{ai|Blade Waltz|Fiora}}, {{ai|Mystic Shot|Ezreal}}, {{ai|Parrrley|Gangplank}}, {{ai|Infinite Duress|Warwick}}, {{ii|Runaan's Hurricane}}, etc.
* ''Pix, Faerie Companion'' fires from ''Pix's'' location, not the location of the unit ''Pix'' is following.
* ''Pix'' does not assist attacks on structures.
* At 2.000 attack speed ''Pix'' will fire an endless stream of bolts. at 2.001 attack speed ''Pix'' will not be able to match the speed and will start to lose bolts.
* ''Pix, Faerie Companion's'' damage is counted towards the unit ''Pix'' is following, as such, it will count as an ally's damage if he is following an ally and it counts as Lulu's damage if ''Pix'' is following her or attached to an enemy unit.
* ''Pix'' cannot be targeted in any way though there is a bug that happens under unknown circumstances that allows for pix to be targeted.
* ''Pix, Faerie Companion'' acts in different ways with effects that would prevent basic attack damage: 
** If the allied champion ''Pix'' is following is [[blind]]ed, Pix and the champion will both miss.
** {{ai|Riposte|Fiora}} will only parry or block one attack, either the allied champion's or one of ''Pix's'' depending on when it was activated.
*** {{ai|Aegis Protection|Pantheon}} will not block any bolt as they deal magic damage, while the basic attacks that caused ''Pix'' to fire can be potentialy blocked
** {{ai|Counter Strike|Jax}} will dodge all of ''Pix's'' attacks along with those of the allied champion he's following.

* ''Glitterlance'' shoots two bolts, one from Lulu and the other from wherever ''Pix'' is when the spell is cast.
** Moving the cursor towards Lulu when targeting will cause the two bolts to cross fire, while moving the cursor away from Lulu will cause the bolts to fire towards the same point.
* Enemies can only be damaged by one bolt. However, they can be affected by the slow of both, refreshing the duration if they hit in succession.
** If an enemy is hit by both bolts, the slow does not stack.
* While ''Glitterlance'' pops spell shield, the target is still able to be damaged and slowed by the second bolt, if the conditions are right, after negating the first with a spell shield.

* ''Pix'' is independent from the [[absorption shield]] when cast on an ally and he will continue to assist the target's attacks even if the shield breaks.
** Likewise, the [[absorption shield]] will persist for the full effect even if the ally target leaves ''Pix's'' leash range.
* While ''Pix'' is away from Lulu, his bolt from {{ai|Glitterlance|Lulu}} will fire from his location toward the cursor.
** Doing so can extend the range of ''Glitterlance'' to be much larger than it normally is.
