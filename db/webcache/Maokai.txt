|additional =
* ''Twisted Advance'' will cancel mid-dash if the target dies or becomes untargetable. 
* Maokai will continue to chase his target even if he loses sight of them.
** There is an occasional bug where losing sight of his target causes the animation to freeze mid-air. Despite how it looks, Maokai will continue to chase his target and Maokai will "blink" to where he should be once he arrives at his target.
* Maokai will follow any dash or blink ability, with the exception of {{ai|Paranoia|Nocturne}}, {{ai|Gate|Twisted Fate}}, {{ai|Stand United|Shen}}, {{si|Teleport}}, and {{si|Recall}}.
* Becoming untargetable will prevent damage from non-targeted spells, such as {{ai|Requiem|Karthus}}, as well as dropping aggro from turrets and AI units. 
** Maokai will safely pass through {{ai|Flame Chompers!|Jinx}}
* Possible Bug: Maokai is able to interact with {{ai|Dark Passage|Thresh}} as he passes over it. His target will become rooted when Maokai arrives at {{cis|Thresh}} location, allowing him to "safely" root people (i.e. root without jumping in).

* ''Saplings'' are untargetable and invulnerable, but will appear on the map as a minion.
