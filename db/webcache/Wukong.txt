* Has no cast time.
* Because the decoy is stopped and won't attack, it is possible to bluff this ability by stopping Wukong.
** The decoy is left in the stop position, but instantly. Because the transition frames from movement animation to stop animation are missing, an experienced enemy can tell the difference.
* The decoy counts as a champion for purposes of being targeted, such as {{cai|Ace in the Hole|Caitlyn}}.
* If the decoy is killed before it vanishes, it will not deal any damage.
