|description = Upon death, Zyra returns to her plant form for up to 8 seconds. After 2 seconds, she gains the ability to cast '''Vengeful Thorn''' using any learned ability.

* '''Vengeful Thorn''' is [[quick cast]] by default.
* Zyra's death timer begins when she dies, not when ''Rise of the Thorns'' has finished. In the event that the respawn timer is shorter than the time she spends in ''Rise of the Thorns'', her respawn timer is extended so that she has a minimum respawn time of 2 seconds.
* Zyra can only fire '''Vengeful Thorn''' with an ability she has ranked. For example, if {{ai|Deadly Bloom|Zyra}} has not been ranked she cannot use the first ability slot or its shortcuts (default: Q) to fire the '''Vengeful Thorn'''.

|description = {{sbc|Passive:}} Zyra gains bonus cooldown reduction.
|description2 = {{sbc|Active:}} Zyra plants a seed at a target location for 30 seconds, granting sight of a small area around it. If one of Zyra's basic abilities hits a seed, a plant will grow that automatically attacks nearby enemies. Extra plants striking the same target deal 50% less damage.

Zyra periodically stores a seed and can hold up to 2 at a time, and can only have 4 seeds placed at any one time. 

After {{fd|1.5}} seconds, enemy champions can step on a seed to destroy it - but will be revealed for 2 seconds.

* '''Seeds''' cannot be targeted by enemies (including towers) and as such will not detonate enemy traps, such as {{ai|Noxious Trap|Teemo}} or {{ai|Bushwhack|Nidalee}}.
* While only four seeds can be placed at a time, there is no limit for the number of plants grown at the same time. With maximum cooldown reduction and max ranked ''Rampant Growth'', it is possible to have 8 plants active for brief amount of time.

{{Ability pet
|name = Thorn Spitter
|icon = Deadly Bloom.png
|render = Thorn Spitter.png
|description = '''Thorn Spitters''' are [[Pet#Minion|static, autonomous minions]]. 
* Apply [[spell effects]] as a [[damage over time]] ability.
** [[File:Hextech Revolver item.png|20px|link=Spell vamp]] [[Spell vamp]] is applied.
** {{ii|Rylai's Crystal Scepter}} will apply a 15% slow.
* Does not apply [[on-hit effects]].
* Does not affect/is not affected by {{ai|Counter Strike|Jax}}, {{ai|Riposte|Fiora}}, {{ai|Aegis Protection|Pantheon}} and [[Blind]], because the basic attacks count as spells.
* Benefits from {{ii|Banner of Command}} and {{ii|Captain}} (although they cannot move).
* Contrary to popular belief, plants will ''not'' prioritize enemy champions by default. While Zyra has an active plant, her basic attacks against champions will "mark" them as a target (placing a small icon above their head). The mark will fade if Zyra loses sight of a marked enemy. Plants will prioritize:
** Marked enemy champions. 
** Zyra's attack target.
** Unknown default priority, likely the nearest enemy. 
* Note that plants will often prioritize enemy champions on their first attack, which will occur almost instantly upon being spawned. Their attack priority will kick in on their second attack. 
* Cannot attack structures.
* Plants take modified damage from all sources:
** Auto-attacks from minions and monsters deal 1 damage.
** Auto-attacks from champions deal 2 damage.
** Area of effect abilities deal 3 damage.
** Single target abilities deal 4 damage. 
** {{cis|Dragon}} attacks deal 4 damage.
** Turrets deal 6 damage.
** {{si|Smite}} and {{ai|Consume|Nunu}} deals 6 damage. 
* {{ci|Baron Nashor}} will ignore plants, as it ignores all non-champion targets.
* Attacks count as spells in the sense that they proc {{ii|Banshee's Veil}} and other spell shields, such as {{cai|Spell Shield|Sivir}} and {{cai|Shroud of Darkness|Nocturne}} as well as spell on-hit effects such as {{ii|Rylai's Crystal Scepter}} and {{ii|Liandry's Torment}}, but does not count as a stack for {{ii|Manamune}} or {{ii|Archangel's Staff}}
* Will stop attacking when silenced, due to the nature of its basic attacks.
