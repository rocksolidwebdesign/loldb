*Shen cannot target himself with ''Stand United''.
*Shen can alternatively target an ally by clicking on their respective champion portrait on the left side of the screen or using the F1 to F5 keys.
*Shen cannot target allies of whom he does not currently have sight of due to a vision-restricting effect, such as {{cai|Paranoia|Nocturne}} or {{cai|Smokescreen|Graves}}. This includes prevention of casting it using the aforementioned methods of clicking the champion portraits and F1-5 keys.
*Using ''Stand United'' on a [[stealth|stealthed]] ally will not remove their stealth.
*Shen's teleport is not contingent on the state of his ally's shield. Breaking the shield will not cancel Shen's channel nor will breaking Shen's channel remove the shield prematurely.
