Gnar's abilities have no cost and are only limited by cooldowns. His secondary resource bar instead displays his '''Rage'''. Gnar starts the game in [[File:GnarSquare.png|20px|link=]] '''Mini Gnar''' form with '''0 Rage'''.

'''Mini Gnar''' will generate {{tt|2-4|Levels 1 to 11, specific scaling unknown.}} Rage whenever he deals damage to any source or takes damage from an enemy champion, plus an additional {{tt|4-8|Levels 1 to 11, specific scaling unknown.}} over 3 seconds. If '''Mini Gnar''' has not dealt or received damage in the last 13 seconds, his Rage will start to decay. Rage generation from combat with minions is reduced. <!--Despite the fact some Riot guy said it was 25%, it doesn't seem consistent and was 50% at one point. Tested by attacking a minion once and attacking a champion once, then seeing how much was generated fully.--> The over-time Rage generation cannot exceed 99 Rage from combat with minions if '''Mini Gnar''' kills the minion.

|description  = When '''Gnar''' reaches 100 Rage, he gains access to an alternate set of abilities. After either {{tt|5|Estimated}} seconds or upon casting an ability, '''Gnar''' will transform into '''Mega Gnar''' for 15 seconds while his Rage depletes. Once his Rage is exhausted, he will turn back into '''Mini Gnar'''  and cannot gain Rage again for {{tt|13|Estimated}} seconds.
