** Vision granted before ''Paranoia'' was cast will be removed, and vision granted after ''Paranoia'' is cast will be negated.
** However, {{si|Clairvoyance}} and {{ai|Destiny|Twisted Fate}} will continue to grant vision for their remaining duration after Paranoia ends.
** Although vision is lost across the map, champions will still retain their own (''but slightly reduced'') field of vision and can spot any enemy or unit that they could see normally.
* ''Paranoia's'' sight reduction does not grant assists.
* Nocturne will track a target that changes location such as by moving, using a [[dash]] ability or using {{si|Flash}}. He will not follow targets that move a great distance using {{si|Recall}} or {{si|Teleport}}, however. In such cases he will simply dash to the target's previous location.
* ''Paranoia'' will prevent an enemy {{ci|Shen}} from using {{ai|Stand United|Shen}} on an ally while it is active, regardless of whether or not he actually has sight of his ally. This includes disabling the ability to cast it by clicking on one of the champion portraits on the left of the screen.
