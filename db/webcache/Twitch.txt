*Using {{si|Recall}} or {{si|Teleport}} when ''Ambush'' is activated will cause Twitch to exit stealth.
**Using {{si|Recall}} or {{si|Teleport}} during ''Ambush's'' fade timer will cause Twitch to enter stealth, but continue channeling the spell.
*Activating consumable items will not break stealth (such as placing a {{ii|Stealth Ward}} or using a {{ii|Health Potion}}). However, activating most items, such as {{ii|Blade of the Ruined King}} will break stealth.
**Activating {{ii|Zhonya's Hourglass}} after activating ''Ambush'' but before entering stealth will not break stealth.

{{Ability frame|R
|{{Ability info
|name = Rat-Ta-Tat-Tat

|description  = {{sbc|Active:}} For 7 seconds, Twitch gains bonus attack damage and 300 bonus attack range (''850 total range'').
|description2 = Additionally, each of his basic attacks will pierce enemies in an 850 length line, with each unit struck reducing the attack's damage by 20% down to a minimum of 40% damage.

|targeting='''Rat-Ta-Tat-Tat''' is a [[buff|self-buff]] ability that also causes Twitch's basic attacks to be replaced by pass-through linear [[skill shot]]s.
|damagetype=physical
|projectile=true
|spelleffects=false
|onhiteffects=The enhanced autoattacks will apply [[on-hit effects]] to all targets hit. [[Critical strike]]s are applied per attack - if it crits on one target, it will crit on all of them.
**The enhanced autoattacks will trigger [[life steal]] on all targets hit for full effect.
**Enhanced autoattacks can be {{ai|Counter Strike|Jax|dodged}}, {{ai|Riposte|Fiora|parried}} and {{ai|Aegis Protection|Pantheon|blocked}}, and will miss if Twitch is [[blind]]ed.
|spellshield=will not block the enhanced autoattacks.
|additional=
*''Rat-Ta-Tat-Tat'' has no cast time and does not interrupt Twitch's previous orders.
**Twitch's attacks during ''Rat-Ta-Tat-Tat'' can outrange turrets (''850 range opposed to the turrets' 800'') meaning he can damage them during ''Rat-Ta-Tat-Tat'' without taking damage from them.
*Twitch's attacks will pass through structures and terrain, but will not damage structures unless they were directly targeted for the attack. The exception is the [[Nexus]] - Twitch's attacks will not deal any damage to it. This is likely a bug.
*For purposes of {{ii|Runaan's Hurricane}}, attacking with ''Rat-Ta-Tat-Tat'' counts as a single auto-attack against a single targeted enemy, and as such will only launch one pair of ordinary single-target bolts to nearby enemies. However, the range bonus applies for all three bolts.
*Twitch will gain a stack of {{mi4|Spell Weaving}} for each enemy hit. He will also gain a stack of {{mi4|Frenzy}} for each enemy hit with a [[critical strike]].
