|{{Ability info
|name=Sunlight
|icon=Sunlight.jpg
|description= Leona's spells charge any enemy unit damaged with ''Sunlight'' for {{fd|3.5}} seconds. When allied champions deal any damage to those targets they consume the ''Sunlight'' debuff to deal {{pp|9|20|35|50|65|80|95|110|125|140|1|3|5|7|9|11|13|15|17}} additional magic damage. 
|description2=This additional damage is counted as the ally's damage and it will benefit from their magic penetration. Leona is unable to activate the additional damage herself.

|{{Ability2
|targeting='''Sunlight''' is an [[spell effect|on-spell effect]] that applies a [[debuff]].
|damagetype=magic
|spelleffects=single
|onhiteffects=
|spellshield=will block the application of the debuff, but will not block the detonation of a mark.
|additional=
* The damage dealt by ''Sunlight's'' mark is credited to the allied champion, not Leona. As such, the magic damage will benefit from their magic penetration and will apply any spell effects they have, including [[spell vamp]].
* ''Sunlight'' does not stack. Further applications of the debuff only refresh the timer.
* ''Sunlight'' has a hidden passive which causes champions wearing sunglasses to take 1 less damage from ''Sunlight'', such as  {{ci|Vayne}}. This extends to champion skins as well, even if their default skin does not normally wear sunglasses, such as {{csi|Singed|Surfer Singed}}.

* The triggering attack will apply other on-hit effects and can critically strike as normal.
** Critical strikes do not interact with Shield of Daybreak's bonus damage.
** ''Shield of Daybreak's'' bonus damage will affect structures.
** ''Shield of Daybreak's'' bonus damage and stun will surpass {{ai|Counter Strike|Jax|dodge}}, {{ai|Riposte|Fiora|parry}}, {{ai|Aegis Protection|Pantheon|block}} and [[blind]].

|additional=
* ''Shield of Daybreak'' will reset Leona's attack timer on cast. Additionally, it has a reduced delay between the next attack, allowing Leona three rapid autoattacks in succession.
* Leona's basic attack range is increased by 30 (''155 total range'') while the effect is active.
* Despite being an on-hit effect, ''Shield of Daybreak's'' damage will trigger spell effects as a single-target spell, including [[spell vamp]], {{ii|Rylai's Crystal Scepter|Rylai's}} slow and will cause {{iis|Muramana}} bonus damage to trigger twice with one autoattack.
