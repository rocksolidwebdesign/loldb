*The reduced damage of the ability scales linearly with channel time <ref>[http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2325425 Reduced Damage of Absolute Zero]</ref>. For example, cancelling after 1.5 seconds will deal around 50% of the full damage, cancelling after 0.1 seconds will deal around 12.5%, and cancelling after 2.9 seconds will deal around 87%. 
*''Absolute Zero's'' area of effect is only visible to enemies if they have vision of Nunu. If he is in the [[Fog of War]] or in [[brush]] while channeling, enemies will not see the spell animation but they can still be affected by it.
