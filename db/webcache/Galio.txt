* ''Runic Skin'' is inversely affected by effects that reduce Galio's magic resistance, such as the {{ii|Abyssal Scepter|}} or {{ai|Dread|Fiddlesticks|Fiddlesticks's Passive}}. The magic resistance reduction will reduce Galio's ability power for the duration of the effect. When Galio's magic resistance is brought below 0, he will lose ability power. Ability power has a lower cap of 0.
* Due to his natural base 30 magic resistance he will begin the game with at least 15 ability power. With the addition of scaling per-level magic resistance, he will gain ~11 ability power at level 18 or roughly 0.6 ability power per level.
* On the other hand, ''Runic Skin'' is triggered by his own ability, {{ai|Bulwark|Galio}}, as well as any other effect that gives him temporary Magic Resist. Casting ''Bulwark'' right before another ability will, therefore, increase the impact of that second ability.
