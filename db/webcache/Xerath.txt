|name = Arcanopulse
|icon = Arcanopulse.png
|description = {{sbc|First Cast:}} Xerath starts channeling for 3 seconds. Xerath can move while channeling, but cannot attack or cast his other abilities. Over the first 1.5 seconds of the channel, ''Arcanopulse's'' range will gradually increase while his movement speed is slowed by up to 50%. 
|description2 = After the 3 seconds, ''Arcanopulse'' will cancel and half the mana cost is refunded.
|description3 = {{sbc|Second Cast:}} After a brief cast time, Xerath fires a beam of energy in a line that deals magic damage to all enemies hit.

* While charging, ''Arcanopulse'' can be interrupted by any form of [[hard CC]]. 
* Arcanonopulse's cooldown starts after firing the beam, not while channeling.
* Once casting, ''Arcanopulse'' cannot be interrupted. During the cast time, Xerath will ignore crowd control effects but still suffers from them if the duration persists. 
* If Xerath is displaced by a knockback or pull effect during the cast time, the beam will fire from the original point of casting. 
* If Xerath dies while charging or during the cast time, ''Arcanopulse'' will not fire but is still placed on cooldown.

* There is an {{ap|0.2}} second casting time that must be completed in order for the beam to deal damage. 
** Cast times cannot be interrupted by crowd control effects, and will only be interrupted by Xerath's death. If Xerath dies during the {{ap|0.2}} seconds, the beam will fizzle after the 0.5 seconds (and will not deal damage). 
** During the cast time, Xerath will ignore crowd control effects but still suffers from them if the duration persists. 
** If Xerath is displaced by a knockback or pull effect during the cast time, ''Eye of Destruction'' will still go off at the target location even if he is no longer in range. 
* The outline of the area of effect will appear the moment Xerath begins casting, and deals damage after the {{ap|0.5}} delay. After the {{ap|0.2}} second casting time, there is no way to stop the blast. 
* ''Eye of Destruction'' grants sight over a large area on-cast, which persists for a short duration after the blast hits.

{{Ability info
|name = Rite of the Arcane
|icon = Rite of the Arcane.png
|description = {{sbc|Active:}} Xerath anchors himself to his current location for up to 10 seconds. While anchored, Xerath is immune to displacement effects and gains the ability to cast [[File:Rite of the Arcane.png|20px|link=]] '''Arcane Barrage''' up to three times, but cannot cast his other abilities. 
|description2 = {{sbc|[[File:Rite of the Arcane.png|20px|link=]] '''Arcane Barrage''' - Active:}} Xerath calls down a blast of arcane energy which strikes after a {{fd|0.6}} second delay, dealing magic damage to enemies within a moderate area.
|description3 = ''Rite of the Arcane'' can be cancelled early by moving or attacking and will automatically end once ''Arcane Barrage'' has been cast 3 times. If ''Rite of the Arcane'' ends without using a single cast of ''Arcane Barrage'', the cooldown is reduced by 50%. Interrupting crowd control effects, with the exception of displacement effects, will interrupt ''Rite of the Arcane'' and put it on full cooldown.

* ''Rite of the Arcane'' has a short activation time where Xerath ascends into his true form. During this time, ''Arcane Barrage'' cannot be activated and a circle indicating the ability's maximum range appears (starting small and rapidly expanding to the maximum range over the cast time). 
** The maximum-range indicator is visible to both allies and enemies. 
* Activating ''Rite of the Arcane'' '''does not''' automatically use the first cast of ''Arcane Barrage'' - you must activate the ability twice in order to first deal damage. 
* ''Arcane Barrage'' uses a [[ability|barrage system]] so that it can be cast multiple time within a given period at no additional cost.
* ''Arcane Barrage'' has a 0.6 second cooldown between casts, not affected by Cooldown Reduction.
* Each cast of ''Arcane Barrage'' grants a brief area of sight. 
* Each cast is classified as an activation for the purposes of effects such as {{ii|Tear of the Goddess|Tear}} and [[Spellblade]]
* Xerath can use {{ai|Dark Passage|Thresh}} while rooted.
