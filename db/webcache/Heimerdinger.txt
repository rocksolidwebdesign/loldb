|description= {{sbc|Active:}} Heimerdinger deploys a turret at the target location. Heimerdinger stores enough parts for a new turret every several seconds (affected by cooldown reduction) but can only keep a limited number of turrets in reserve. Up to 3 turrets can be deployed at a time and deploying a fourth turret destroys the oldest one.
|description2=Turrets have '''525'''-range basic attacks and a '''1100'''-range laser beam. The laser beam is a pass-through skill shot that fires upon reaching 100% charge. Charge generates passively and the turret's basic attacks will generate additional charge, with a maximum recharge time of 16 seconds. Turrets deactivate if Heimerdinger is more than 1000 units away for longer than 8 seconds.

|description= {{sbc|{{ai|UPGRADE!!!|Heimerdinger}} - Active:}} Heimerdinger constructs an [[Heimerdinger#Pets|Apex Turret]] that lasts for 8 seconds. The ''Apex Turret'' deals modified damage based on the rank in ''UPGRADE!!!'', and its basic attacks deal 100% splash damage, apply a 25% movement speed slow, and generate 20% beam charge per hit. The beam attack is also twice as wide. The ''Apex Turret'' does not count toward Heimerdinger's turret limit, nor does it interact with his turret reserve.

* Leveling-up and ranking-up ''H-28G Evolution Turrets'' will not affect the stats of any existing Turret. 
* A number of small metal nuts can be seen orbiting Heimerdinger's model to represent the number of turret kits he has available. 
* ''H-28Q Apex Turret'' can be cast even if Heimerdinger has no turret kits in his reserve. The 1 second cooldown still applies, however, if Heimerdinger has recently constructed a H-28G Turret.

{{Ability pet

|icon = H-28G Evolution Turret.png
|render = EvolutionTurret.png
|description = '''H-28G Evolution Turrets''' are [[Pet#Minion|static minions]] that attack nearby enemies. 
* Classified as a [[pet#minion|minion]] for targeting purposes.
* The turret's basic attacks do not apply [[spell effects]] or [[on-hit effects]].
* The turret's laser beam applies [[spell effects]] as an area of effect ability.
** [[File:Hextech Revolver item.png|20px|link=Spell vamp]] [[Spell vamp]] is reduced to one-third effectiveness.
** {{ii|Rylai's Crystal Scepter}} will apply a 15% slow.
* {{ii|Banner of Command}} will increase the magic damage dealt by a turret's basic attacks.
* Turrets take 40% increased damage from melee champion autoattacks<ref>[http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=42688476#42688476 Turret and Melee Champion]</ref>.
* Turrets will prioritize Heimerdinger's attack target or enemies attacking Heimerdinger with its basic attack, and nearby enemy champions with its laser beam. An enemy champion that a turret is targeting or attempting to target will have a metal nut icon, even if they are outside the turret's range.
* Turrets will try and attack the same target if within range.
* Turrets are created with 70% charge, meaning they can fire their first beam after a maximum of {{fd|11.2}} seconds (reduced by the turret's attacks.) The current charge is displayed as a bar below the turret's health bar. 
* The laser beam has a short wind-up time and the line-of-fire is telegraphed to both allies and enemies, similar to {{ai|Zap!|Jinx}}
* A 8-second timer appears beneath the turret while Heimerdinger is out of range, representing the time until it goes offline (visually similar to {{cai|Cell Division|Zac|healing chunks}} and {{cai|Sweeping Blade|Yasuo}}). The laser beam loses all current charge when it goes offline. Turrets will instantly come online the moment Heimerdinger moves back in range. 
* Offline turrets still grant sight, albeit over a reduced area (~200-radius).
* {{Pending for test}} {{ai|Counter Strike|Jax}}, {{ai|Riposte|Fiora}}, {{ai|Aegis Protection|Pantheon}} and [[Blind]]. <!--All of them only mitigate physical damage-->
