|name = Shadow Walk
|icon = ShadowWalk.jpg
|description = {{sbc|Passive:}} When out of combat for 6 seconds, Evelynn enters [[stealth]], only being able to be seen by enemy champions within 700 range or true sight. While stealthed, Evelynn regenerates {{as|1% of her maximum mana}} every second and ignores unit collision.
|range = 700

|additional=
* Evelynn's movement animation is changed whenever ''Shadow Walk'' is active.
** A puff of purple smoke will also appear whenever ''Shadow Walk'' activates.
* When ''Shadow Walk'' is active a grey circle apears around Evelynn indicating the range from which enemies will have sight of her.
* Whenever Evelynn approaches a visible enemy champion, there will be an eye hovering above the enemy's model, that is only viewable by Evelynn. This eye changes color based on how far away Evelynn is from the enemy champion:
** <span style="color:yellow">Yellow</span> means Evelynn is close to being revealed.
** <span style="color:red">Red</span> means Evelynn is being revealed to the enemy team.
*** An exclamation symbol will appear over Evelynn, that is viewable by Evelynn and her allies, when being revealed by at least one visible enemy champion.
* The red eye will not appear above an enemy champion regardless how close he stands next to Evelynn, if she's covered by [[brush]] or by the [[Fog of War]].
* If Evelynn's ''Shadow Walk'' is active and she goes in the detection range of an enemy champion she has no sight of, she will be seen but her stealth will not break.
*If Evelynn is in stealth close to an enemy champion (yellow eye icon) but comes into the range of an enemy {{ii|Vision Ward}}, the enemy's eye icon will turn red and the exclamation mark will appear as if she was in the detection range.
* The following are things that will also break Evelynn out of stealth.
** Using certain [[summoner spell]]s: {{si|Clarity}}, {{si|Exhaust}}, {{si|Heal}}, {{si|Ignite}}, {{si|Recall}}, {{si|Smite}} and {{si|Teleport}}.
*** Evelynn will enter stealth when using {{si|Recall}} or {{si|Teleport}} after 6 seconds of it being cast.
** Using item actives, {{ii|Sweeping Lens}} and {{ii|Oracle's Lens}} included.
** Capturing a Tower or a Great Relic in [[Dominion]].
*** Evelynn will enter stealth after 6 seconds of the Capture Animation start.
* Placing wards, activating any consumable items or using {{ii|Scrying Orb}} / {{ii|Farsight Orb}} will not break ''Shadow Walk's'' stealth.
* Capturing a neutral altar in [[Twisted Treeline]] will trigger the exclamation mark over Evelynn and the red eye hovering above the altar, making Evelynn visible to nearby enemies. Capturing an enemy altar instead will only trigger the yellow eye hovering above the altar, but will make Evelynn visible to all enemies on the map.
