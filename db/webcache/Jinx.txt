|targeting= '''Switcheroo!''' is a [[toggle]]d ability that grants Jinx an [[on-hit effect]] that varies depending on her current equipped weapon. 
|damagetype=Physical
|spelleffects=false
|spellshield= Will have no effect.
|additional=
* Triggering ''Switcheroo!'' does not proc {{ii|Sheen}}, {{ii|Iceborn Gauntlet}}, {{ii|Lich Bane}} and {{ii|Trinity Force}}.
*{{ai|Pow-Pow|Jinx|Pow-Pow, the Minigun}}
** While {{ci|Jinx}} is visually using ''Pow-Pow'' from the start of the game, she does not benefit from the bonus attack speed until ''Switcheroo!'' has been leveled. 
** While using {{ii|Runaan's Hurricane}}, ''Pow-Pow'' will generate one stack per enemy hit. 
* {{ai|Fishbones|Jinx|Fishbones, the Rocket Launcher}}
** While the main target of ''Fishbones'' will not be affected by spell effects such as {{iis|Rylai's Crystal Scepter}} or [[spell vamp]], targets hit by the splash portion will be affected as if the damage were an area of effect spell.
** Aside from your first basic attack, your basic attacks while ''Fishbones'' is active will not utilize the bonus attack speed and none of your attacks will refresh the timer on the stacks from {{ai|Pow-Pow|Jinx}}.
** While ''Fishbones'' is active, if you try to attack and do not have enough mana to fire a rocket ''Switcheroo!'' will go on cooldown and revert to {{ai|Pow-Pow|Jinx}}.
** It is worth noting that Jinx has the 4th lowest attack speed at level 18 in the game, with only {{fd|0.731}}. While having the full 3 cumulative stacks of bonus attack speed from ''Pow-Pow'' puts her at the fastest attack speed while not utilizing an active ability, her attacks are considerably slower than other champions while using ''Fishbones''. 
** Jinx has the second longest static attack range with rank 5 ''Fishbones''; out-ranged only by a level 18 {{ci|Tristana}} by 3 units. 
*** Including bonus attack range from activated abilities, Jinx is out-ranged only by {{ci|Tristana}} at level 18, {{ci|Kog'Maw}} with rank 5 {{ai|Bio-Arcane Barrage|Kog'Maw}} activated, and {{ci|Twitch}} with {{ai|Rat-Ta-Tat-Tat|Twitch}} activated.
** [[On-hit effect]]s are only applied to the primary target, and not to any targets hit by splash damage.
** The 10% bonus damage dealt to Jinx's primary from ''Fishbones'' will apply [[life steal]]. 
** The splash damage will not occur if Jinx's attack is {{ai|Aegis Protection|Pantheon|blocked}}, {{ai|Counter Strike|Jax|dodged}}, {{ai|Riposte|Fiora|parried}}, or if the attack [[blind|misses]].
** The splash damage will still occur while attacking towers and will draw aggro.
** The on-hit splash damage effect from ''Fishbones'' will be triggered with each bolt from {{ii|Runaan's Hurricane}}. The splash around secondary targets will deal {{as|10 + 50% AD}}. Any targets in the splash range can also be damaged by the splash damage from the other targets and splash damage areas will stack if they overlap, allowing for a maximum damage of {{as|20 + 210% AD}} to the targets or tertiary enemies standing in all three areas of splash damage (not factoring critical strikes or damage modifiers).
*** {{mi4|Spell Weaving}} and {{mi4|Blade Weaving}} appear to interact inconsistently with ''Fishbones'' and {{ii|Runaan's Hurricane}}; all of the projectiles will trigger {{mi4|Spell Weaving}} when they hit a Champion, but the splash damage and extra projectiles will not trigger {{mi4|Blade Weaving}}, the splash only triggering {{mi4|Blade Weaving}} if damaging another champion.
*** Note that the secondary targets of ''Runaan's Hurricane'' can be up to 375 units away, meaning it is not guaranteed that the splash damage areas will overlap. However, ''Runaan's'' prioritizes the closest enemies to your target - making it relatively easy to overlap at least two areas of damage. 
*** ''Fishbones'' consumes mana per attack, not per target hit. As such, {{ii|Runaan's Hurricane}} will not drain any additional mana for the additional bolts it fires. 
** While using {{ii|Muramana}}, ''Fishbones''' mana cost is deducted before ''Muramana's'' damage is calculated.
