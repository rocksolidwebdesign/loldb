|description={{sbc|Active:}} For up to 2 seconds, Jax dodges all basic attacks and takes 25% less damage from area of effect abilities.

* ''Counter Strike'' is not a [[channel]]ed ability and Jax will hence still dodge attacks and stun opponents when the buff duration ends even if he is suffering from [[crowd control]] effects.
* ''Counter Strike'' will also dodge spells that can proc [[on-hit effects]], including {{cai|Parrrley|Gangplank}}, {{cai|Mystic Shot|Ezreal}} and {{cai|Blade Waltz|Fiora}}, among others. These dodged abilities will count towards Counter Strike's increased damage.

The triggering attack will apply other [[on-hit effects]] and can critically strike as normal.
** Critical strikes will not interact with ''Grandmaster's Might's'' bonus damage.
** The bonus damage will not trigger on structures.
** {{Pending for test}} ''Grandmaster's Might's'' interaction with {{ai|Counter Strike|Jax|dodge}}, {{ai|Aegis Protection|Pantheon|block}}, {{ai|Riposte|Fiora|parry}}, and [[blind]] has yet to be tested.
|spellshield=will block the ability.
|additional=
* ''Grandmaster's Might'' has no cast time and does not interrupt Jax's previous orders.
* Despite being an on-hit effect, ''Grandmaster's Might's'' damage will trigger spell effects as a single-target spell, including [[spell vamp]], {{ii|Rylai's Crystal Scepter|Rylai's slow}} and will cause {{iis|Muramana}} bonus damage to trigger twice with one autoattack.
* Although the bonus damage cannot affect structures, hits against them will still increment the counter, resulting in Jax repeatedly triggering the loud sound effect after three strikes.
* The bonus armor and magic resistance is calculated when the ability is cast. Further changes to Jax's attack damage and ability power will not cause the bonus stats to dynamically adjust.
