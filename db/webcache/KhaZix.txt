* Kha'Zix can still use summoner spells and item actives while he is in the air.
* ''Leap's'' speed depends on the distance of the jump. Melee range jumps are near instantaneous while long range jumps leave Kha'Zix in the air for significantly longer.
* Kha'Zix is still targetable while jumping and is considered to be on the ground for the purposes of skillshots such as {{cai|Enchanted Crystal Arrow|Ashe}} and {{cai|Mystic Shot|Ezreal}}
** Crowd control effects, like [[stun|stuns]] and [[snare|snares]], will take effect upon landing.
** Knock-up effects like {{cai|Pulverize|Alistar}} and {{cai|Howling Gale|Janna}} will cancel the jump and knock Kha'Zix into the air at his current location
** Knock-back effects, like {{cai|Headbutt|Alistar}} and {{cai|Monsoon|Janna}}, pulls like {{cai|Rocket Grab|Blitzcrank}} and {{cai|Death Sentence|Thresh}}, and throws like {{cai|Fling|Singed}} and {{cai|Rolling Thunder|Volibear}} will all cancel the jump and then complete their effects as normal.

* ''Void Assault'' has no cast time and does not interrupt Kha'Zix's previous orders.
* Each ranking of ''Void Assault'' will bring up a secondary selection menu that allows Kha'Zix to choose the ability to next evolve. Selecting one will cause Kha'Zix to begin channeling, receiving the evolution when it ends. He may not evolve an ability more than once.
* Although the evolution is represented as a channel, applying hard [[crowd control]] to Kha'Zix as he is evolving will not cancel the process as it does for most channeled spells. Even if Kha'Zix is killed partway through the channel, he will still receive the evolution buff.
* If Kha'Zix emerges victorious in the [[The Hunt is On!]] [[event]], he will receive a fourth evolution point to spend on his final unevolved ability. This is the only way through which he may evolve all of his abilities at once.
