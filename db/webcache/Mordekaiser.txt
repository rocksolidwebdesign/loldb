|description  = {{sbc|Active:}} Mordekaiser deals magic damage to a target enemy champion and curses it for 10 seconds, dealing additional magic damage over time and healing himself for the damage done.
<br><br>If the target dies while under the effect of the curse, their soul is enslaved as a controllable ghost and will follow Mordekaiser for 30 seconds. The Ghost cannot use any active skills or items and deals magic damage with its basic attacks.
|description2 =
The Ghost's stats are:
{{lc|Health}} The enslaved champion's total health plus 15% of Mordekaiser's total health.
{{lc|Attack Damage}} The enslaved champion's base AD at Lv. 1 plus its bonus AD from items and 75% of Mordekaiser's total AD.
{{lc|Ability Power}} The enslaved champion's AP plus 75% of Mordekaiser's AP.
{{lc|Movement Speed}} The enslaved champion's base movement speed plus the bonus from Mordekaiser's boots.

|additional=* Even though Mordekaiser is already healed for the full damage dealt, {{ai|Iron Man|Mordekaiser}} triggers as well, effectively giving Mordekaiser 135% of the damage dealt's worth in health.
* If ''Children of the Grave'' kills {{ci|Karthus}}, {{ci|Kog'Maw}} or {{ci|Zyra}}, Mordekaiser will not gain the ghost until the end of their passives.
** While those champions are under the effect of their passive, Mordekaiser will not gain the stat increase because the ghost is not yet alive.
** Similarly, if ''Children of the Grave'' kills a unit affected by {{cai|Omen of Death|Yorick}}, then the Omen will trigger first, and Mordekaiser will not gain the bonus stats until it ends.
* If ''Children of the Grave'' kills a target protected by {{cai|Chrono Shift|Zilean}} or {{iis|Guardian Angel}}, or a {{ci|Zac}} or {{ci|Aatrox}} with {{ai|Cell Division|Zac}} or {{ai|Blood Well|Aatrox}} available, respectively, the ''Children of the Grave'' debuff is removed and Mordekaiser will no longer gain the effects.
* The ghost does not disappear when the corresponding champion respawns, or uses {{si|Revive}}. That means a champion and his ghost can exist simultaneously, and potentially fight each other.
* While in stasis from effects such as {{ii|Zhonya's Hourglass}} or {{ai|Chrono Shift|Zilean}}, Mordekaiser cannot issue commands to his ghost. His ghost will continue with its previous orders, or stand idle if it has none.
* ''Children of the Grave'' debuff can be removed with [[Named item effect#Quicksilver|Quicksilver]].
* The ghost's basic attacks can critically strike.
* The ghost dances if Mordekaiser dances too.
