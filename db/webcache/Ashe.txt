* ''Frost Shot'' cannot be toggled-on or off while [[crowd control|unable to activate abilities]].
* The cost is per ''attack'', not per ''hit''. While using {{ii|Runaan's Hurricane}}, Ashe will only pay the mana cost once per attack. Likewise, she will still pay the cost even if the attack is blocked, parried, dodged or if it misses.
* The slow trail is visible even if the target is [[stealth]]ed. 
* Toggled abilities do not count as ability activations for the purposes of effects such as [[named item effect#Spellblade|Spellblade]] or {{ai|Force Pulse|Kassadin}}.
