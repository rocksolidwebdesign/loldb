|description  = Upon taking fatal damage, '''Sion''' briefly becomes invulnerable then enters a frenzy, restoring himself to full health but begins to drain a percentage of his maximum health per second, draining faster the longer he is alive. '''Sion''' can freely move and attack during this time, gaining 100% [[lifesteal]], attacking at {{fd|1.75}} [[attack speed]] and dealing {{as|10% of his target's maximum health}} as on-hit physical damage (''capped at 75 bonus damage against monsters'').
|description2 = Additionally, '''Sion''' gains the ability to cast {{ai|Death Surge|Sion}} using any learned ability.

*Sion can cast item actives during "Glory in Death".
* The attack speed granted by ''Glory in Death'' isn't additive with Sion's base attack speed: it sets his attack speed to a '''static''' number. If Sion's standard attack speed exceeds {{fd|1.75}} attacks per second, ''Glory in Death'' will actually '''decrease''' his attack speed.
* Sion's death timer will begin to tick down when he is first killed, not when ''Glory in Death's'' reanimation expires.
* The cooldown of ''Death Surge'' is refreshed upon triggering ''Glory in Death'', meaning it is always available to cast at least once. Realistically, it is unlikely that a reanimated Sion will survive to cast ''Death Surge'' more than once.
* Sion cannot use [[summoner spells]] while in the ''Glory in Death'' state.
* ''Glory in Death'' will still trigger if Sion is killed by the [[Nexus Obelisk]].
* ''Glory in Death'' occupies a low priority for effects that trigger upon death: it will always trigger '''after''' effects such as {{iis|Guardian Angel}} or {{cai|Omen of Death|Yorick}}.
* {{cai|Children of the Grave|Mordekaiser}} will spawn its ghost only if Sion dies in both normal state and ''Glory in Death'' state while under its effect.
