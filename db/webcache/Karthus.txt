*Karthus cannot use basic attacks or [[summoner spell]]s while in the ''Death Defied'' state.
*{{ai|Defile|Karthus}} will automatically be toggled on if Karthus has at least one rank in the ability, and it cannot be toggled off for the duration.
*''Death Defied'' occupies a low priority for effects that trigger upon death: it will always trigger '''after''' effects such as {{iis|Guardian Angel}} or {{cai|Omen of Death|Yorick}}.
*Karthus will still benefit from cooldown reduction during ''Death Defied's'' duration.
*''Death Defied'' will still trigger if Karthus is killed by the [[Nexus Obelisk]].

*''Lay Waste'' against a single target applies [[spell effects]] as a single target ability.
**[[File:Hextech Revolver item.png|20px|link=Spell vamp]] [[Spell vamp]] is applied.
**{{ii|Rylai's Crystal Scepter}} will apply a 35% slow.
*''Lay Waste'' hitting multiple targets applies [[spell effects]] as an [[area of effect]] ability. 
**[[File:Hextech Revolver item.png|20px|link=Spell vamp]] [[Spell vamp]] is reduced to one-third effectiveness.
**{{ii|Rylai's Crystal Scepter}} will apply a 15% slow.
*''Lay Waste'' grants a small instance of [[sight]] before detonation.
*''Lay Waste'' hitting a single target lists damage as a [[critical strike]] both in the damage text in game and in the post-game screen, where the damage from Karthus's most powerful Lay Waste will appear in the post-game's "Largest Critical Strike" section of the graphs.
**{{Pending for test}} Despite this, ''Lay Waste'' can not actually critically strike and, as such, does not scale with Critical Strike Damage even if it hits a single target.
