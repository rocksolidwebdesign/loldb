*''Aegis Protection'' does not consistently negate [[on-hit effects]] that would be applied with the blocked attack. 
**On-hit crowd control effects are never blocked, such as {{ai|Shield of Daybreak|Leona}} and {{ai|Ruthless Predator|Renekton}}, although their damage may be. 
**Three abilities that are not blocked are {{cai|Pick A Card|Twisted Fate}}, {{cai|Devastating Blow|Poppy}} and {{cai|Mace of Spades|Mordekaiser}}, as these attacks are entirely magic damage and do not deal any physical damage to trigger ''Aegis Protection''.
*''Aegis Protection'' will also block all abilities that apply on-hit effects, such as {{ai|Parrrley|Gangplank}} or {{ai|Mystic Shot|Ezreal}}.

**Although he visually leaves the entire screen midway through the ability, Pantheon is still considered to be targetable for the entire channel. The damage of the ability will still occur if Pantheon is CC'd before he lands.
