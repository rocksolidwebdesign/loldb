* ''Mirror Image'' will trigger whenever it is off cooldown and LeBlanc has less than 40% of her maximum health, even if LeBlanc does not take any damage when it becomes available. 
{{ci|Mirror Image}}:
* Classified as a [[pet|clone]].
** ''Mirror Image'' can be controlled by Alt + Right-Click (''default Hotkeys'').
** ''Mirror Image'' can be commanded to move or attack (''and it will automatically move to follow its attack target'').
** ''Mirror Image'' has a leash range of approximately 1125.
* When summoned, the clone will automatically run away from the source of damage that brought LeBlanc below 40% health. If ''Mirror Image'' triggered without damage, the clone will run in the direction LeBlanc is facing.
* Does not benefit from {{ii|Captain}} or {{ii|Banner of Command}}.
* ''Mirror Image's'' basic attacks apply [[on-hit effects]].
* ''Mirror Image's'' basic attacks do not apply [[spell effects]].
* The ''Mirror Image'' does not benefit from attack damage (''it attacks as if it had 0 AD''). As such, it will not apply life steal and critical strikes will have no effect.
* While LeBlanc is unable to activate her basic abilities, she cannot command her clone.
