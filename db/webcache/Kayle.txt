|onhiteffects=The triggering attacks will apply other [[on-hit effects]] and can critically strike as normal.
** Critical strikes do not interact with the bonus damage of ''Righteous Fury''.
** {{iis|Tiamat|cleave}} and {{iis|Ravenous Hydra|Cleave}} Cleave will not proc while ''Righteous Fury'' is active while the {{iia|Runaan's Hurricane}} passive will. 
* {{ai|Counter Strike|Jax|Counter Strike}} and {{ai|Aegis Protection|Pantheon|Aegis Protection}} will block the AD damage from ''Righteous Fury'', but not the bonus magic damage. The AOE will still proc. 
* {{ai|Blinding Dart|Teemo|Blinds}} will cause ''Righteous Fury'' to miss. The AOE will still proc.  
* {{Pending for test}} ''Righteous Fury's'' relationship with {{ai|Riposte|Fiora|parry}} has yet to be tested.
* The bonus damage does not affect structures. 
|spellshield=will not block the ability.
|additional=
* Despite being an on-hit effect, both ''Righteous Fury's'' damage to the primary target and the area of effect component apply [[spell effects]] as an [[area of effect]] ability. 
** [[File:Hextech Revolver item.png|20px|link=Spell vamp]] [[Spell vamp]] is reduced to one-third effectiveness.
** {{ii|Rylai's Crystal Scepter}} will apply a 15% slow.
* The splash will ''not'' trigger upon attacking towers, but ''will'' upon attacking inhibitors.
* A [[Cooldown reduction]] of 37.5% or greater will allow Kayle to have a continuous use of ''Righteous Fury'' until her mana is depleted.
* ''Righteous Fury'' has no projectile and thus bypasses [[Yasuo|Yasuo's]] {{ai|Wind Wall|yasuo|Wind Wall}}.
