* Tristana can still attack and use abilities, summoner spells and item actives while she is in the air.

* Tristana is still targetable while jumping and can be hit by skillshots such as {{cai|Enchanted Crystal Arrow|Ashe}} and {{cai|Mystic Shot|Ezreal}}
** Non-airborne crowd control effects, such as [[stun]]s and [[snare]]s, will take effect upon landing and will ''not'' cancel the jump.
** All airborne crowd control effects, such as [[knockup]]s and [[knockback]]s, ''will'' cancel the jump and then complete their effects as normal.
