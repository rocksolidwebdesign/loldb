|name=Warpath
|icon=Warpath.jpg
|description= '''Hecarim''' ignores unit collision and gains bonus attack damage equal to {{pp|7|15|17.5|20|22.5|25|27.5|30|1|3|6|9|12|15|18}} % of his bonus movement speed.

*''Warpath's'' attack damage bonus will adjust itself to any temporary movement speed buffs Hecarim receives, such as those from {{ii|Talisman of Ascension}}, {{cai|Song of Celerity|Sona}}, {{si|Ghost}} or [[Speed Shrine]] in [[Dominion]]. This also can be detrimental - ''Warpath'' will be adversely affected by [[slow]]ing effects, such as from {{ii|Randuin's Omen}} or {{cai|Wither|Nasus}}. However, Hecarim will not dip below his regular attack damage if he is slowed below his base movement speed, as Warpath only counts his bonus movement speed.
*Hecarim has no unit collision of his own, and does not block other units' pathing. Potentially, this can have the dubious effect of allowing him to completely obscure the click area of a minion or smaller allied champion with his large hitbox.

|{{Ability info
|name=Rampage
|icon=Rampage.jpg
|description  = {{sbc|Active:}} '''Hecarim''' cleaves nearby enemies, dealing physical damage (66% damage against minions and monsters).
|description2 = If '''Hecarim''' damages at least one enemy unit with this attack, he gains a stack of ''Rampage'' for 8 seconds, reducing the base cooldown of this ability by 1 second. This effect can stack up to 2 times.

|spellshield=will block the damage.
|additional=
*''Rampage'' has no cast time and does not interrupt Hecarim's previous orders.
*''Rampage'' stacks reduce the ability's '''base''' cooldown, distinct from the usual flat cooldown reduction of abilities such as {{ai|Undertow|Olaf}} and {{ai|Arcane Mastery|Ryze}}. This means cooldown reduction from items, runes or masteries is applied after the reduction from any ''Rampage'' stacks. This makes Rampage's minimum cooldown 1.2 seconds at 40% cooldown reduction and 2 ''Rampage'' stacks, instead of 0.4 seconds.

|description  = {{sbc|Active:}} '''Hecarim''' surrounds himself with the spirit of dread for 4 seconds, dealing magic damage per second to all enemies within its reach.
|description2 = Hecarim is healed for 20% of the damage dealt by any source to enemies within the area (capped against minions or monsters).

*''Spirit of Dread'' has no cast time and does not interrupt Hecarim's previous orders.
*''Spirit of Dread'' will heal Hecarim for damage from any source from any enemy whatsoever, including [[basic attack]]s, [[abilities]], [[items]], and [[summoner spells]] sourced from himself, allied champions, allied structures, [[minions]] and even neutral [[monsters]].
**The sole exception to this is for abilities that cost health - Hecarim will not heal if an enemy expends health to cast a spell within Spirit of Dread's radius.
*''Spirit of Dread's'' minion healing cap is based on total healing from all minions. This means that Hecarim can only be healed for up to {{ap|60|90|120|150|180}} health regardless of how many minions are affected by the spell.

|name=Devastating Charge
|icon=DevastatingCharge.jpg
|description  = {{sbc|Active:}} '''Hecarim''' gains 75% movement speed over the course of 3 seconds, starting with initial 25% upon cast, and ending one second afterward.
|description2 = While '''Hecarim''' is charging, he gains 150 extra attack range (''325 total''). His next attack knocks the target back, dealing physical damage based on how far '''Hecarim''' has traveled during ''Devastating Charge's'' duration.
|description3 =  If '''Hecarim's''' target is beyond narrow terrain, Hecarim will leap over the terrain to his target.
|leveling2={{lc|Minimum physical damage}} {{ap|40|75|110|145|180}} {{as|(+ 50% bonus AD)}}

|onhiteffects=The triggering attack will apply other [[on-hit effects]] as normal but cannot critically strike.
**The bonus damage from ''Devastating Charge'' will apply [[life steal]].
**''Devastating Charge's'' bonus damage will affect structures.
**''Devastating Charge's'' bonus damage will not go through [[blind]], {{ai|Aegis Protection|Pantheon|block}}, {{ai|Counter Strike|Jax|dodge}} and {{ai|Riposte|Fiora|parry}} but the knockback will still be applied.
|spellshield=will block the enhanced autoattack.
|additional=
*''Devastating Charge'' has no cast time and does not interrupt Hecarim's previous orders.
*''Devastating Charge'' resets Hecarim's autoattack timer on cast.
*''Devastating Charge's'' cooldown begins on cast, not when the buff expires.
*Unusually for a [[movement speed]]-increasing ability, the percentage movement speed bonuses provided by Devastating Charge are applied multiplicatively and not additively.
**For example, the ability in tandem with a {{ii|Trinity Force}}, {{si|Ghost}} and no other modifiers will result in a net movement speed modifier of (100%{{plus}}8%{{plus}}27%){{times}}175%{{equals}}'''236%''' instead of 210%.

|{{Ability info
|name=Onslaught of Shadows
|icon=OnslaughtofShadows.jpg
|description  = {{sbc|Active:}} '''Hecarim''' summons spectral riders and charges forward with them in a line, dealing magic damage to enemies in their path.
|description2 = Enemies within range of where '''Hecarim''' stops will flee in terror for 1 second.
The wave of spectral riders will travel the maximum distance possible in the direction of the cast, regardless of where '''Hecarim''' himself stops.

|damagetype=magic
|spelleffects=area
|onhiteffects=
|spellshield=will block the fear, but do not block the riders' damage.
|additional=
*''Onslaught of Shadows''' flee will only be applied to enemies near Hecarim when he finishes his charge. It is not applied to enemies that are only hit by the riders. This is not conversely true - enemies who are feared by Hecarim will always receive the damage as well.
*''Onslaught of Shadows''' flee is distinct from the usual [[fear]] in that affected units will always travel '''away''' from Hecarim for its duration, and it has a different Loss of Control Indicator icon to show this. The flee is dynamic, meaning that the affected target will continue running away from Hecarim, even as he continues to move himself, allowing some degree of control over where affected units will run.
