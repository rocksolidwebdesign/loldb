Orianna is accompanied by {{ai|The Ball|Orianna}}, which is the focus of her abilities. It attaches itself to Orianna if she walks near it and also blinks back to Orianna if she is too far away. 

Whenever Orianna does not have {{ai|The Ball|Orianna}} attached to her, an arrow will appear near her, pointing toward '''The Ball's''' location. This arrow changes color depending on Orianna's distance from '''The Ball'''.
* <span style="color:green">Green</span> (<span style="color:blue">Blue</span> in colorblind mode) means '''The Ball''' is close.
* <span style="color:yellow">Yellow</span> means '''The Ball''' is a fair distance away.
* <span style="color:red">Red</span> means '''The Ball''' is far away, and moving just a bit further will make it blink back to Orianna.
Using any ability sets off a {{fd|0.15}} second global cooldown.
* {{ai|The Ball|Orianna}} has a leash range of 1125, or 1225 if {{ai|Command: Protect|Orianna}} attaches it to an allied champion.
** However, unlike most subordinate objects, '''Orianna's Ball''' is not targetable by any means.
* '''The Ball''' reveals a small area around its current location, approximately 550 vision range, allowing it to be used for scouting.
* '''The Ball''' ignores terrain, and can be placed inside terrain such as trees, walls and turrets.
