|spellshield=will block the stun and provide immunity to stuns from the same instance of ''Event Horizon''.
|additional=
*''Event Horizon'' can only stun an enemy once per cast. An enemy will not be stunned twice if they walk through the perimeter again after recovering from an initial stun.
*Abilities that cause enemy champions to move interact with ''Event Horizon'' differently:
**[[Dash]] abilities will cause enemy champions to be stunned if they move across the barrier. The dash movement will still be completed even if the moving champion is stunned mid-dash.
**Forced movement through knockbacks and pulls such as {{ai|Rocket Grab|Blitzcrank}} work similarly to dashes.
**[[Blink]] abilities such as {{ai|Riftwalk|Kassadin}} and {{si|Flash}} are not inhibited by ''Event Horizon''.
